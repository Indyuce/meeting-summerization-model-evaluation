The meeting started with the Project Manager introducing herself and the team members. The team members introduced themselves and drew their favourite animals. The Project Manager then introduced the project's goal, which is to create a new remote control with original, trendy, and user-friendly features. The team members were divided into three parts - functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. They will work individually and then come together to collaborate. The team members were asked to draw their favourite animal and tell something about it. The Project Manager drew a turtle, and the team members shared their favourite animal characteristics. The team members also shared their reason for choosing the animals they did. The Project Manager then moved on to discuss project finances, stating that they aim to make a profit of 15 million Euros from the sales of the remote control. They need to produce each one at a maximum of 12.50 Euros and are selling it for twice that price.

The meeting ended with the Project Manager thanking everyone for their participation and encouraging them to continue working together.


The group discussed their experiences with remote controls, including the number of buttons and features they liked or didn't like. They also discussed the importance of having an easy-to-use remote control and having a device to help find it if it's lost. They also mentioned the importance of batteries not being too small and not having too many buttons. The group discussed the possibility of creating a remote control for a television only, and whether or not to include buttons for a video recorder. They also discussed the possibility of having a separate remote control for special functions.


The group discussed their individual roles in the project and the tasks they will be responsible for. They will be working on the design of the remote control, including its size and buttons. They will also be considering the user requirements and trends in the market. The next meeting will be in 30 minutes and they will receive specific instructions from their personal coach. The group will be discussing their individual progress and contributing ideas. They will also be sending out the minutes of the meeting and the slides they created. The group will be busy and they will be checking the company website and emails for updates.
