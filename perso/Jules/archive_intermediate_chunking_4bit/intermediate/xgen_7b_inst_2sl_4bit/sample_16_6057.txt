The group discussed a prototype of a remote control that is made out of rubber, has ergonomic and simple design, and is made to be double curved. The buttons are placed in a way that is convenient for the user to access them, with the power button on the thumb, channel up on the index finger, channel down on the middle finger, volume up on the ring finger, and volume down on the pinkie. The remote also has a lock button with a L L on it and a mute button. The group also discussed the possibility of making a left-handed and right-handed version of the remote.

The prototype was created with the goal of making it edible because kids eat Play-Doh, and it is chew-proof. The group also discussed the costs of the remote and the need to consider the size of the hand when making it. The group also discussed the importance of making the remote look different and innovative.

The group is evaluating a remote control design. They are evaluating the remote control based on several criteria, including the look and feel, new technology, ease of use, and cost. The group is using a scale of 1-7 to rate each criterion, with 1 being the best and 7 being the worst. The group has evaluated the remote control and given it a rating for each criterion. The group is pleased with the results and is confident that the remote control will be a success.

The text is a summary of a meeting discussing a remote control design project. The project manager praised the team for their individual and collective contributions to the project, noting that everyone came up with their own ideas and worked together well. The team had heated discussions but kept the project on track. The project manager mentioned that Sony or another company may be using their ideas for a remote control. The project was within budget and the prototype was made, and the team had designed a product that was not already on the market. The team is not sure how much profit they will make, as that information is not in their control. The project was successful and the team is proud of their work.

The group discussed a pen with a camera attached to it. The pen would not be a new idea, but the camera would be used to display the image on a computer screen rather than actual text. The group also discussed hand writing recognition on the pen, but it is just the first step. The meeting adjourned.
