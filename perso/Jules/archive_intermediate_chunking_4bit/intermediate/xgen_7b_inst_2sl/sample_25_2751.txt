The meeting was kicked off by the Project Manager, Mandy, who introduced the team members and the purpose of the meeting: to design a new remote control for a product. The team members were instructed to draw their favourite animal and share their favourite characteristics about it. The Project Manager then led a discussion on the functional design of the remote, including its purpose, how it will work, and what it will control. The team members were instructed to discuss their ideas for the remote control and share their experiences with remote controls. The meeting concluded with the Project Manager assigning roles for the project and setting a project plan.

They also discussed the importance of battery type and size, and the need for a clear instruction booklet. The group also discussed the need for a remote that can handle different variations in signal and the importance of a design that matches the curvature of the hand. The group also discussed the need for a high-tech looking remote with simple functionality.
