The first meeting of Real Reaction's television remote control development project was held. The project aims to create a product that is original, trendy, and user-friendly, and is open to all team members' contributions. The team consists of Andrew, Kendra, and Kate, who will present information, statistics, and creative ideas, respectively. The meeting is structured to allow for open discussion and creative ideas. The main design tool is the whiteboard, and the team will draw their own favourite animals. The goal is to make a product that sells for 25 Euros, has a gross profit of 50 million Euros, and costs 12 Euros and 50 Euros to make.


The group discussed their experiences with remote controls and their preferences for a remote control design. They mentioned that they would like a remote control that is easy to use, has a clear layout of buttons, is not too complicated, and is durable. They also mentioned that a remote control should be able to switch between TV and DVD player with ease, and that it should be easy to find when lost. The group also discussed the physical appearance of a remote control, with ideas ranging from a pen-shaped remote to a mouse-like remote with concave buttons. They also mentioned the importance of a remote control being able to light up or have some sort of indicator to show that it is working. The group discussed the marketing of a new remote control and the need to appeal to both those who want a fashionable and stylish remote control as well as those who prioritize practicality. They also discussed the importance of having a clear industrial design for the remote control.


The group discussed the design of a new remote control. They discussed the importance of making it dependable and easy to use, with a medium size that is not too big or small. They also discussed the possibility of using interchangeable face plates to change the look of the remote control, and possibly marketing it together with a set colour or as a separate thing. They also discussed the possibility of releasing novelty covers for the remote control, such as different scenes from movies.

The meeting is scheduled to reconvene in 30 minutes to further discuss the design of the remote control.
