The group is discussing the design of a remote control for televisions. The management has placed new requirements on the group, including that the remote control only cover televisions, and that the company logo and colours be incorporated. The group will also have to incorporate the company logo at the bottom of the screen, and keep in mind that people may still look at other things even when they don't use teletext anymore. The device should also be simple, quick to market, and attractive to the market. The group will have individual reports from each member, and will then summarize and send out notes. The group will also consider the functionality requirements from the research lab, which include the need for multiple functions and buttons, and the need for the remote control to match the user's operating behaviour.


The meeting discussed the design of a remote control for a TV. The group discussed the number of buttons on the remote control and how it would look. They also discussed the possibility of making the remote control more comfortable to use and incorporating a system where pressing a button on the TV would cause the remote control to beep or make a sound. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating speech recognition technology into the remote control. The group discussed the relevance of different functions on the remote control and how often they are used. They also discussed the possibility of removing certain buttons from the remote control if people do not use them frequently enough. The group also discussed the possibility of making the remote control buttonless and using voice recognition instead. They discussed the age structure of people who use remote controls and how many use speech recognition technology. They also discussed the possibility of making the remote control more user-friendly and incorporating a system where pressing a button on the TV would cause the remote control to beep or make a sound.


The group discussed the relevance of two out of ten functions for a remote control. They identified that channel and volume are essential functions, and they need to design something that looks interesting and different. They can incorporate the logo and colours and still have interchangeable Fascias. They also discussed the possibility of having a voice recognition function, and they could make it fashionable and fashion over practicality. They can also make it cost-effective by removing buttons and making it visually distinctive. They can also make it dual function, with buttons controlling the things that people would do all the time and voice functions controlling the functions that people would use less often. They also discussed the possibility of having a user-friendly design and fewer buttons, and they should have the logos for the company and the colours.


The group discussed the design of a remote control for a TV. They discussed the shape, buttons, and energy source. They also discussed the need for a user-friendly interface and a way to locate the remote control if it is lost. They also discussed the possibility of using a rechargeable battery or a battery dock to keep the remote control charged. They also discussed the need for a big energy source that won't die out and a wide range of buttons that can be pressed from anywhere in the room. They also discussed the possibility of using infrared technology and the need for a locating device on the remote control.


The group discussed the design of a remote control for a digital television. They discussed the idea of a rechargeable battery that lasts for 5 to 10 years and the possibility of using a cordless phone's base as a charger. They also discussed the idea of using a combination of battery and light-dependent battery to power the remote control. The group also discussed the importance of simplicity in the design and the role of the user interface designer. They also discussed the possibility of using voice recognition technology and the only buttons that they think are necessary, which are channel control, volume control, and on/off.


The group discussed the design of a remote control for a television. They agreed that the remote should incorporate the corporate logo, use the grey and yellow colour scheme, and have interchangeable covers. The group also discussed whether they would be designing the remote only for televisions or for other devices such as DVD players. The group agreed that they would be designing the remote only for televisions and they would give some thought to this for the next meeting.
