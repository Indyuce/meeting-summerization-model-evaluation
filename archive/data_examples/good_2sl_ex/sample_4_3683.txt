A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.
<ID> You have to paint now.
<ME> Oh.
<ID> So you're next.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Well we will try.
<ME> Where it going?
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> That's uh strange.
<ID> What is going on?
<UI> pop-ups.
<ID> What are you What?
<ME> Hmm.
<UI> What is this, Pictionary.
<ME> Uh Mm.
<ID> Um Is a It is a It is a A duck.
<UI> Uh a bird.
<UI> Bird.
<ME> So Now save?
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> Now uh blank?
<ID> Blank, yes.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> No problem.
<UI> Shit happens.
<ME> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> A parrot.
<ME> Wow.
<UI> Ish.
<ME> Oh.
<UI> He did it before.
<PM> Uh No, no.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Nice.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> Right, so start of the first meeting.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> Right, so agenda of the first meeting.
<ID> Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> We uh are to get acquainted.
<ID> So does everyone want to say who they are?
<ID> that seem sensible?
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> I'm Robin.
<ME> I'm the Marketing Manager.
<UI> I'm Louisa.
<UI> I'm the User Interface Designer.
<PM> I'm Nick.
<PM> I am the Industrial Designer.
<ID> And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader.
<ID> Alright okay, so tool training.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Project plan.
<ID> So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required?
<PM> Tool training.
<UI> I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training.
<ID> Neither am I.
<ID> Oh I see, so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay, so.
<ID> So we have the project team, which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device.
<ID> Uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time.
<ID> And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one, and to to be trendier, to be with it, and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design, the conceptional design, and the detailed design.
<ID> So um in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves, the designers of this uh this device.
<PM> Yes.
<ID> And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before.
<ID> And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day.
<ID> Um and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end.
<ME> Mm-hmm, okay.
<ID> So we've got tool training.
<ID> Try out whiteboard.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> So we will um.
<ID> Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there.
<ID> I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works.
<ID> So uh I don't know who wishes to go first.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever.
<UI> I don't mind.
<ME> I dunno.
<UI> Um.
<ID> Ah uh.
<UI> Let's see.
<UI> Good job I got pockets today.
<ME> Your microphone's just Yeah.
<ID> But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera.
<ID> I take it that I would I would guess so.
<UI> Are we supposed to do this right now, do you think, or?
<ID> Or Technical problems.
<PM> You've lost uh your microphone there.
<ME> I don't know.
<UI> Oh.
<UI> Right here we go.
<ID> I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat.
<UI> Little smiley cat there.
<UI> Um and this would be because they're very independent, uh they're very intelligent, compared to dogs maybe.
<UI> Um and they can be very very affectionate.
<UI> Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats.
<UI> Um.
<UI> Um and they can look after themselves.
<ID> Next.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<PM> I'll I'll Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything.
<UI> Shall I rub that out, actually?
<ID> I don't see as there's any need to.
<ID> There's plenty of space.
<ID> I mean whatever.
<ME> We can have have a whole menagerie.
<ID> Exactly.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> There's one.
<ID> We've had more time to prepare over this side, so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets.
<PM> Didn't think of that.
<PM> 'Kay uh pens are over here.
<ID> The three pens are underneath.
<PM> I'll try the red pen.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Um.
<PM> I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well, but I'll have a bash at it.
<ID> You get marks for artistic impression.
<PM> Uh.
<PM> Ooh ooh I lost it there.
<PM> I think I've just knocked the microphone.
<PM> Um.
<ID> So you're just doing the face.
<PM> We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear.
<PM> Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that.
<PM> Great.
<ME> Right.
<ME> Hello.
<ME> Um I'm gonna go for the dog, and I'm gonna draw one badly as well.
<ME> Uh.
<ME> looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something.
<UI> That's quite good.
<ME> Right.
<ME> There's my dog.
<ME> Um I like dogs because they're very loyal.
<ME> And they're always happy, so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired, they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited.
<ME> So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog.
<ME> And they're also good for exercise as well.
<ME> You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired.
<ME> And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well, so.
<ME> Okay, that's why I like dogs.
<ID> Right, um.
<ID> Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh I'm not too keen on them anyway.
<ID> Not to worry.
<ID> So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw.
<ID> Uh As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well.
<ID> Anyway um.
<ID> And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever, you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you.
<ID> Whereas if you got fish, you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months, and buy in a few plants, so.
<ID> Other than the fact that they keep dying, uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance.
<ME> Great.
<ID> Right.
<ID> Okay, uh if we're still all with us.
<ID> Right okay, so.
<ID> Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> That information has come from our marketing manager here.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> So we're looking to sell internationally, not just in Europe.
<ID> We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit.
<ID> And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit.
<ID> And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time.
<ID> So um Experience with remote control, first ideas.
<ID> New remote.
<ID> So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were.
<PM> Yes.
<ID> So uh any any thoughts?
<PM> Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons.
<PM> As that is the main function.
<ID> Okay, so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily.
<PM> Yes.
<ID> Um we're looking for a device that is uh What was the other things you said there?
<PM> Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible.
<ID> Easy to use.
<ID> Use.
<PM> is easy to use and see.
<ID> And see.
<PM> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Uh.
<UI> Can I just check?
<UI> Is this just a television remote?
<UI> Because a lot of um systems are kind of TV video combined now, or TV DVD combined.
<UI> And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<UI> So if you've got a combined system, it could be a combined remote.
<ME> Mm.
<UI> Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing?
<ID> Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that.
<ID> But it seems to me sensible, 'cause as you rightly said, there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> And uh So a device for for all remotes.
<ME> I've Okay.
<PM> Sorry, you go.
<PM> You go.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well.
<ME> 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots.
<ME> And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room.
<ME> So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel, now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote.
<ME> So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room.
<ME> I don't know.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Comes to your whistle.
<ME> That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television, but Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> But is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive.
<ID> You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well, you want any idiot to be able to use it.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Whilst at the same time you want, as you rightly said, one remote for all.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes, therefore they're more with handling them, therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on.
<PM> Yes.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote.
<PM> Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself, or sort of the instructions that would come with it?
<ID> Better instructions.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ME> So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television, your stereo, and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well, maybe.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting.
<ID> So uh we have to uh start winding up.
<ID> Um is there Next meeting in thirty minutes.
<PM> 'Kay.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> So um Right, so we've got ID the Come on, where's my Oh there we go.
<ME> If you just click return it should be okay.
<ME> It'll get rid of the message.
<PM> Or not.
<ME> If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message.
<ME> Oh you've got.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> That's what I was looking for.
<ID> Right.
<ID> So we've got function Oh what happened to the Right.
<UI> I think that might be back to the start.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down?
<PM> slide four Okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Right.
<ID> Sorry about that.
<ID> Okay, so we've got um the working design for ID.
<ID> For UID the technical functions design.
<ID> Marketing, the user requirement specification.
<ID> Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach.
<ID> So.
<ID> Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes?
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting.
<PM> Yes.
<PM> 'Kay, yes.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for.
<UI> Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it?
<PM> I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control, so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise.
<ID> Television remote control.
<UI> Right.
<ID> That's true, 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going.
<ME> Okay cool.
<ID> But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a TV.
<ID> Okay?
<PM> 'Kay.
<ID> So we will depart.
<ID> We will stay here and uh and break off.
<ID> And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour.

### Assistant: The group met for the first meeting of a project to design a new remote control device. The goal is to make the device more user-friendly and trendy than the previous one, and to be able to sell it internationally. The project team will split up into functional, conceptional, and detailed design phases, and the meeting will be used to hand over to the designers of the device. The user interface designer will draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard, and the designer will draw a cat. The group will then discuss ideas for the new remote control.
