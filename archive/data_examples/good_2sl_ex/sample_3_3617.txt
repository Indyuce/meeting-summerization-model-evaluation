### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.
<ID> You have to paint now.
<ME> Oh.
<ID> So you're next.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Well we will try.
<ME> Where it going?
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> That's uh strange.

<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.

<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Everybody ready?
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> I think so.
<ID> Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is?
<ME> Yeah, that's a good plan.
<ID> So maybe we start with you?
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah, my name is Francina.
<PM> And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<PM> And my role is to design uh a television remote control.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> And I'm a marketing person.
<ME> I wanna figure out how to sell them.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And your name is?
<ME> My name is Eileen.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui.
<UI> Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> And as you already know I am Betty.
<ID> I am the project manager for today.
<ID> So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Yes y opening, acquaintance, tool training well, the tools are, I think, we already I guess the tool is really our the computer, as far as I can see.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there.
<ID> Project plan, that falls under the same heading pretty much.
<ID> Um, I don't think we have any great discussion at this point.
<ME> No.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Here is what this thing should be.
<ID> This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control.
<ID> Uh should be original, trendy, and, of course, user friendly.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So maybe you wanna make some notes of that.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay?
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> All right.
<ID> Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.
<ID> Um.
<ID> That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with.
<ID> The same goes for the conceptual design, there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards.
<ID> Detailed design, same thing basically.
<ME> Mm 'kay so Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Functional, conception and detailed.
<ID> I can't write with this thing.
<ME> Maybe we should redesign it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that.
<ID> Yeah, okay.
<ID> All right?
<ID> Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal.
<ID> Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works?
<ID> So that in case we have to, in the next meeting, present something on the white board.
<ID> You wanna go Eileen and Whether you without hanging yourself.
<ME> Okay, I'll see what I can do.
<ME> See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something.
<ID> And remember you have to press so it works.
<ME> So that it will record okay.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Um uh um traditional kitty cat.
<ID> Fat, a fat cat.
<ME> I've a very fat cat.
<ME> And it likes to sit like that.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> And you're Francine, right?
<PM> Yes, I'm Francina.
<ID> Would you like s like just to see um how it feels, so that you have a little idea?
<PM> Yes, sure.
<ME> Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay.
<ID> In No, no.
<ID> No, that's okay.
<PM> No, Okay.
<ID> I don't know, we'll get to that later.
<ME> Okay.
<PM> What should I draw?
<UI> Snake.
<PM> I'm going to draw a snake.
<PM> How does it look like?
<ME> Uh, okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes.
<ID> Here's the project finance uh which, of course, we all have to think about when we design this thing.
<ID> Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro.
<ID> Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro, the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Profit.
<ME> Um is fifty mm.
<ID> So these are all things, of course, to remember with the budget and when you design to materials, cost, etcetera.
<ID> Now, uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control?
<ME> Oops.
<UI> Yeah, of course, using remote control.
<ID> I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em, right, everyday.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it, things you would like to change, things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas?
<ID> Would you like it to be smaller, bigger, have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons, you know, things like that?
<UI> Uh.
<PM> Yeah, I Yes, I I feel that all the remote should be very compact.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Small, right.
<PM> Yeah, those which we get here nowadays it's very long.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<PM> And um and it should have multi-purpose.
<PM> Like uh the remote control which we use for TV, it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also, like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners, or for heating system.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Audio player.
<UI> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically.
<PM> Yes, exactly Yes.
<UI> Hmm.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Divides us Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Exactly.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> At um twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that.
<ID> Well.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things.
<ID> It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have.
<ME> That's right.
<UI> Yeah, of course.
<ID> Now, of course, the other thing to think there is maybe the design.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah, design should be, yeah it should be different.
<PM> All the almost all the remotes Yes, exactly.
<ID> Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know.
<UI> Yeah, maybe ten I do yeah, colours and al shapes also.
<ID> Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know.
<PM> Are different shapes.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Um so yeah shapes right, you know, like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something, you know.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Yeah of course yeah.
<ME> Yeah okay, friendly shape, that would help.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap, because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> They can't find it.
<ID> That is true, because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or, we you know, whatever.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the TV off and they say, where the hell is my my remote control yeah?
<ME> So some Uh so, so it's really the beep or, or a light should blink.
<ID> Well or yeah or if it's really, if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal.
<UI> Yeah, some beep or something like that, so that we can go Yeah.
<PM> Or a b Should ha A fluorescent signal, yeah.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So if lost If lost uh signal with b throw signal, you know.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is.
<ID> Exactly, I mean just that's what I'm saying.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> May not be beep.
<ID> I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or Okay, my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden, in in other words if it's like in a dark spot, uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top, a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant, at that moment it's it's like, it's like um, what you call it a light s sensors, you know?
<UI> Beep or uh it's a light, maybe it's a light.
<ME> And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink?
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Okay so Okay.
<ID> In in that moment it has a sensor, i it it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep, I mean, that we can discuss that later, you know.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Yeah, probably yeah, probably it's a yeah, yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> And uh Yes.
<ME> So the light sensor would activate the signal.
<ID> That's right.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough.
<ID> Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff, you know, you can clap on and off, but I think they only work to certain degree and What with Oh yeah well, but then those people we can't help everybody.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it.
<UI> Yeah, of course, that didn't I i we can't do it.
<ME> Well, because you're s because you're silly.
<PM> Then, in that case Yes.
<ME> Because people are silly.
<ME> I mean it could be on well, i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um, you know, well maybe we have to move along, okay.
<ID> Okay we have uh yeah, we have to move along, but I think we have some good good points to start with here.
<UI> Yeah, good point.
<ID> Okay, the next meeting will be in thirty minutes.
<ID> I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this?
<UI> Me yeah.
<ID> Okay so well, you got the notice um uh.
<ID> The working design, I guess that's the function ID uh who is this?
<ID> The industrial designer That's you.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, it's functional de yeah, exactly, technical.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So, we looking for a working design when we come back.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> Uh working design, yeah, it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design.
<ID> Then And then the technical funct you are the technical function, so so you are the working design.
<UI> Yeah, functional design, and you Yeah.
<ID> So you have a working design and then a functional design.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, and what we just discussed in general.
<ID> That would be your idea.
<ID> And, of course, price.
<ID> That it, that it, that the price is a good price.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> I mean, the price is given, but, that was That's right.
<ME> We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price.
<ID> That's right.
<ID> And, you know, specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that.
<ID> I think that's the end of the show.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> So um we have well, we have a twen two two two three minutes.
<ID> Um any questions at this point?
<ID> Or uh suggestions?
<ME> Mm.
<ID> I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh, uh I guess, you can uh Mm-hmm.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Okay, I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting.
<UI> Yeah, even I have.
<ME> How about you people?
<UI> Yeah, even I have, I think, yeah.
<PM> Yes.
<ME> Really?
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Alright, well uh Okay, very good.
<UI> Yeah, so let's see.
<ID> Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes.
<PM> Yes.
<ID> And see what we can come up with.
<UI> Hmm.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Okay?
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Yeah.

### Assistant: The group discussed the design of a new remote control and the functional, conceptual, and detailed design stages. They will present their ideas and discuss them in the next meeting. They also discussed the budget and the profit range for the product. The user interface designer will be responsible for designing the user interface and the industrial designer will be responsible for designing the technical-functional designs and specifications.
