A: Oh .
B: It's not saved yet .
C: Okay .
B: So Our beautiful drawing .
A: Okay .
A: So just f um So this is our agenda .
A: You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
D: Oops .
C: Okay .
A: Uh I didn't Oh yeah .
A: So these are the So these are the um last notes we I made .
C: Oh , okay .
C: Yeah .
A: If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then .
A: I don't have to put it in the report .
B: Are we doing the the speech recognition ?
B: Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .
A: Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially .
A: So if you want to , it's okay .
B: Okay yeah .
B: Well then then we're gonna put it in .
A: Okay , just Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
B: Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .
C: Yeah , and Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ?
C: Or fold open ?
C: I don't know .
C: It's probably better .
C: Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions .
A: Maybe that's better .
C: Yeah .
A: Yeah , that's that's a very good point .
B: Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside .
C: Think that's better .
B: So you can make it very easy to use .
B: 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .
A: Yeah .
A: Okay .
A: So this is okay ?
B: No .
B: Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .
A: Okay , so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is .
C: The Yeah , I I think so .
A: But um Okay , for the Okay .
B: Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .
C: I don't know .
A: No , you have a different chip for speech recognition .
A: So So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget .
B: Okay .
C: Ah okay .
A: So it's okay .
B: Good .
A: So you can show your prototype if you want to .
C: Yeah .
B: Together ?
C: Yeah , it's Let's do it together .
B: I'll give comments .
C: Okay .
C: Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements .
C: Uh the look-and-feel model .
C: Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there .
C: Simply a square with uh round corners .
C: So that's basically it .
C: Uh the material should be hard plastic .
D: Mm-hmm .
C: Uh colour changeable , and also transparent .
C: And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know .
C: Um then the elements .
C: Uh we have The functions are just basic .
C: Like uh I've pointed them here .
C: Mute function , on-off function , text functions .
C: This uh switch channel .
A: Okay , cool .
C: And this is the the num-pad .
C: And the logo is over here , and the mic .
A: Okay .
C: And the scrollwheel , no ?
C: You operate that with your pointing finger .
D: Means Okay .
C: So you hold it like this in your right hand and Uh I dunno .
A: Mm .
A: So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
B: Speech recognition .
A: Yeah , speech recognition .
A: Just Only one button to say it's on or off .
B: Um I didn't have a specification of that .
B: But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something .
B: Um so I've Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .
C: Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .
A: So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
B: Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back .
C: Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know .
B: That's for sure .
A: Okay .
B: That's uh We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons .
C: Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .
B: But You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
A: Yeah , you can put it separate .
B: You Yeah I know .
B: I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something .
B: So But it's enough room .
C: Yeah .
C: Um the position ?
C: Yeah , you write uh You wrote this , so .
B: Uh well Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .
B: That was the the most important thing .
B: So uh the best place , the best reach place Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
B: Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out .
B: That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up .
B: Uh scrollwheel is on the left side .
B: It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
C: Yeah .
C: But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed .
C: So y Because you can use your thumb then .
B: Yeah .
D: Just just one thing now .
D: Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine .
B: Okay yeah , they Yeah okay .
D: But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .
C: Mm yeah .
B: That's that's below that then .
C: Yeah , okay .
B: It's uh twelve buttons .
C: just so you get that .
D: Okay , but It's rather important .
B: Yeah okay , just we just missed that .
C: Yeah .
B: But um I'll just uh I'll get back to later .
B: F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device .
B: So um should be popular .
B: Um The f uh the buttons creating ?
B: Uh if you That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
A: Okay .
B: So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .
B: Um we'll use hard plastic .
B: Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .
B: Colour changeable .
B: Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up .
B: We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
D: Okay .
B: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it .
A: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?
B: So when you pre Yeah .
A: How do you want to implement that ?
A: Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ?
B: We're going to implement .
B: Yeah .
B: Mm just a little Yeah .
D: Ah .
C: Yeah , these are just basic functions , so All the non-basic are in Okay .
A: Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .
C: Um Okay , maybe we use this button for the Yeah .
D: Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions .
D: It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart .
D: Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player .
D: That function must be Yeah , maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .
B: Yeah , I um To your video device .
A: Yeah , as well .
A: Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .
C: A second level ?
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
C: Like a a new blank one or Or just here ?
A: No no , just on Down there .
B: Is i Ah okay .
C: Okay .
A: So uh Just uh if you s Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: And h how does the second level come out ?
D: Uh it slides uh along ?
B: Um slides I think .
B: It's You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough .
D: From from the uh beneath ?
A: For the bottom .
A: No , you gotta slide it .
B: If that breaks then you're screwed .
A: Yeah , it's right .
B: So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open .
B: Um Uh i the the speech functions buttons .
C: So what do we need ?
C: Yeah , just God damn it .
D: Menu ?
B: Menu button .
B: With uh maybe uh arrows .
B: So you can uh scroll in the , navigate the menu .
B: Um I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels .
D: Scart ?
D: Uh yeah .
D: And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left .
B: So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera .
D: Yes .
C: So this is the Extern or something .
B: That's used pretty often .
D: Yeah .
B: If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .
D: It's a f basic uh Yeah , to navigate .
A: Yeah .
A: You want to save that file as well ?
A: The drawing ?
B: That was it .
C: So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .
B: Uh It doesn't really matter .
A: Doesn't really matter .
C: I don't know the functions .
A: Just just uh Yeah .
B: That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm ?
C: Okay .
C: What else ?
C: What else ?
B: What else ?
B: Uh menu buttons with arrows .
C: Uh menu .
C: Uh With arrows .
B: S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do .
B: Mm where do we have Or there .
C: Like a normal um Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button .
B: Like on the normal uh Like this .
B: The menu button , yes .
C: Okay .
B: Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires .
B: So you can't redesign it .
D: Mm okay .
D: Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
A: Yeah .
B: Yep .
D: Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .
A: Yeah .
B: Just press it once , the colour should uh switch .
B: Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?
D: okay .
A: Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it .
A: Just red , yel uh red , green and That's that's very easy , yeah .
D: Okay , yeah .
D: Th Yeah .
D: If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .
C: Yeah , okay .
C: We can put those here .
D: Colour buttons .
D: And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Okay .
A: Yeah .
B: Yep .
A: Okay .
D: Okay .
D: That's uh Um It Some text uh buttons .
C: So did we miss anything ?
B: Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
C: Okay .
A: Yeah .
D: Yeah , but there's one there's one text button I There's one text button I prefer .
B: I just uh The volume logo .
A: No , ma on on o on the on the Yeah .
C: Oh wh Here ?
B: Yeah .
C: Okay .
A: Just make it Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .
C: Yeah , or th or the Yeah .
D: That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text .
B: Yeah , we have that on the the text button .
D: Do you do you Did you think of that ?
C: Yep .
C: Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext .
C: You just switch it off and then Well w we thought of a text button .
B: Uh why not ?
D: Ex Yeah .
D: Yeah .
B: No Whoa I think um Yeah , the three stages .
C: And if you press it again , you get the the the through view .
D: The sta the state you Yeah .
A: Oh just three stages , you Yeah , that's okay .
C: Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off .
B: Yes .
C: So you can switch back from second to w first .
B: No , it doesn't have to turn it off .
D: No .
B: Just don't Yeah .
D: Just remember where it was .
D: It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page .
D: If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ?
A: Yes , that's to remember .
C: Okay , okay .
A: Yeah , but that's that's uh That's a functionality for the television .
D: But maybe it's not the way Mm .
B: I dunno if Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah .
D: That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .
C: Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television .
B: Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the the chip .
C: Th th th if you switch it on .
A: Okay .
A: Yeah , but you have to search every time again .
C: Th i Yeah , I dunno .
A: That's what what happening if you do it like that .
B: Yeah , that's true .
A: But it's still the television that has to do that .
C: Okay .
B: So yeah .
B: Um do we need to fix that or Just like your telephone , hard plastic .
D: Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .
A: No , that's what the television does .
C: Yeah , those memory functions .
D: But uh not not every every television , so Yeah , I I thought about one thing .
C: Yeah .
A: Okay , it's cool .
C: Was uh this logo for uh volume ?
A: Yeah , that's fine .
C: Okay .
C: So that's it ?
A: Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?
D: Uh the buttons ?
D: Uh from which material are they now ?
C: Mm .
C: No no Yeah .
C: Just hard plastic .
D: Okay .
C: So Uh I think just um Yeah , but I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
D: Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ?
A: It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
D: Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?
B: I think just on the buttons .
B: If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .
D: Well yeah .
D: That's too much place .
D: Okay , just leave it .
B: I don't think the space is worth it .
D: Just leave it .
D: Yeah , and i The most time Yeah , with rubber buttons .
D: Yeah , okay .
D: Okay .
D: Fine .
A: Yeah ?
A: Okay , cool .
A: Mm mm mm mm mm .
A: Yeah , I don't know what this means .
A: But I think we just evela evaluated this one .
D: Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model .
A: Oh okay , you made some criteria .
A: Okay , cool .
A: Okay .
D: I d d d I don't think if it's right .
D: That shall show it .
A: You have some usability criteria or Okay .
D: Mm-hmm .
D: Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about .
D: Uh Oh .
C: In the bottom .
D: Yeah .
A: Look-and-feel ?
D: Evaluation crit Yeah , evaluation presentation .
C: No , evaluation is Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .
D: It's not in .
D: Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something .
D: Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market .
D: The Italians uh , how they think about it .
D: And The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff .
D: I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero .
D: We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our um model .
A: Okay .
D: And this These are all I I I found , or I wrote down .
A: Okay .
D: And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven .
D: Uh Yes .
A: Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea .
A: It quite beautiful .
A: It's We are actu We are the Flashy .
B: Mm .
D: Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something .
D: And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff .
B: Okay .
B: Well I think we do If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
D: The LEDs .
D: Yes .
D: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ?
A: But uh It's black .
B: Hmm ?
D: The basic colours are black or green or yellow ?
D: Or you haven't thought about Ho how do we make uh Black and yellow .
B: Um basic colours , um yeah .
B: Well you didn't say .
B: Maybe um company colours ?
B: Black .
A: Yeah , yellow light .
B: A bit a bit of yellow .
D: Can Black white , maybe ?
A: Do we have yellow light ?
A: No , not really , but it's possible .
B: Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow .
A: It's Yeah , different colours .
B: Like white , also ni or uh always nice .
C: And what colours should the buttons be ?
D: Uh Because um Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ?
A: This is Oh , the same as th th the cover .
B: Just um Yes .
A: But also th the light behind it .
C: But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?
A: No , no .
A: Make them No , just make them black or grey or something .
B: Yeah , grey .
B: Just dark grey I think .
C: Okay .
A: Yeah .
D: Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .
B: Well we have changeable fronts , so So Yeah .
D: Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .
A: Yeah , just give it a one .
A: It's okay .
A: It's perfect .
A: I think it's just what you want .
A: Or not ?
B: It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .
C: Yeah .
C: It's ju so subjective .
B: It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .
D: Yeah .
A: Okay , just give it a two .
D: A two .
D: Okay .
D: The fancy look-and-feel .
D: That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons .
B: Yeah .
D: Okay .
D: And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think .
A: Yeah .
C: One more thing .
D: So Slide panel ?
C: Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ?
C: Or n no back light ?
C: Yeah ?
B: Mm .
A: No .
B: Not needed .
A: No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers and uh That as well , yeah .
B: Yeah , not needed I think .
C: And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ?
D: Oh , you mean th this here ?
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
A: Yeah , but that's unnecessary .
B: What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
D: It's pretty cool .
D: If you slide it open , it lights up .
D: That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable .
A: Yeah .
B: Of course it's reachable .
A: It doesn't make No .
D: Then we do it .
C: Hmm .
B: Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up .
B: So you can see what's really there .
B: Not just not re on the buttons or something .
A: Yeah .
B: Just a green light or some blue light .
B: To light it all up .
D: Yeah , but Okay .
A: But Yeah .
A: Mayb Okay .
C: Yeah , just backlight .
C: Not not the buttons .
C: And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons .
B: Yeah .
C: So the buttons are just grey .
B: Well yeah .
B: Uh semi-transparent .
A: Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right .
C: Okay .
D: Okay , fine .
A: So Yeah , that's how I think .
D: So I I think it's very fancy .
D: So I'll give it a Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so I think it's one .
B: Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so Yeah .
A: Ye Yeah , this It is a one .
A: It's okay .
A: It's cool .
D: Okay , next .
A: This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use .
D: Learnable ?
D: Easy to use ?
D: Yeah , we shall test it But uh Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: It's That's No .
C: No , but you don't have to use that .
C: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer .
C: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .
B: So I think it's easy to use , but And learnable is a bit Well y just uh f Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .
D: Learnable ?
D: It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control .
C: Well , I think it is .
D: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel .
D: I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Uh then the re Yeah .
A: But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use .
C: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
B: Yes .
D: Okay .
B: But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
D: Okay .
D: But Yeah .
B: It's Yeah it's Device .
A: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .
D: But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ?
D: And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls .
D: So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide .
D: You must slide it .
D: And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls .
D: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use .
A: But yeah .
D: Because easy to use comes after learnable .
B: Okay .
A: Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two .
D: I I think it a three or something .
B: Maybe three then .
B: Learnable's Yeah okay .
A: No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .
C: Mm uh .
C: The normal .
B: Yeah .
C: And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know Yeah .
B: Yep , true .
B: Then a two .
D: Oh .
D: Okay .
A: Okay .
D: New features .
D: Techno technological innovative ?
C: The speech function and the colour .
D: The speech function is new .
B: And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
C: Colour .
D: The scrollwheel and the slide .
D: Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
A: Slide is not n is is not new .
A: No .
A: I already have a Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight .
D: Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
D: Okay .
A: And they all have a slide in it .
A: So that's not new .
B: But also slide that buttons come out , as well ?
A: Yeah .
B: Okay .
D: Okay , and the the the lightning ?
A: That's cool .
D: Is that new ?
A: Yeah for a Uh for a f There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again .
D: The lighting's new .
C: Mm it's pretty new , I think .
B: Yes .
D: Scrollwheel .
D: Speech ?
C: Speech is new .
B: Different colours , so Yeah .
D: Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .
C: Yeah .
D: So we have a pretty new uh It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .
B: That would And we didn't uh But then we also have the the home station .
A: But If you have Yeah .
B: We are forgetting about that now , but We don't recharge .
D: Uh-oh .
A: Oh yeah , that's right .
D: Home-station .
A: Rechargeable .
C: Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .
B: But that's more like uh now .
A: Yeah , just draw it afterwards .
B: I don't know .
A: If you Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ?
A: In the the project uh map ?
B: Uh Just save , save as ?
A: Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Uh save as ?
A: No , that's not in the project .
C: Well it's a already in the folder .
C: L like number seven .
A: Oh yeah , okay .
D: Yeah .
A: Smart board .
B: Okay .
A: Yeah , but this one .
A: This one is not yet in the Oh oh .
C: I think it is .
B: Yeah , it is .
C: No , I think it is .
B: Uh untitled ?
B: Yeah , it doesn't matter .
B: Save .
C: Okay .
D: Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven .
A: But you still have to draw the resi the recharger .
A: Okay .
A: And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ?
A: No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one .
D: No , we are not extraordinary new or something .
A: But not No , just so it's still a two .
D: Tha tha that No , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty .
C: Mm two , I think .
B: N Mm .
A: Targeted audience .
A: Uh we are the targeted audience ?
A: Do we like it ?
A: Yeah , but l younger than forty .
D: Yes .
A: So we we are exactly the targeted group .
D: Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ?
D: Th that's my question .
A: I think so , yeah .
A: You get the fancy things for younger people .
A: And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .
C: Yeah .
C: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience .
A: So you want Yeah , you get different colours .
D: Yeah .
C: So think that's a two or a one .
D: Yeah .
D: Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question .
C: Yeah , but s it That's basically not not handy .
C: And I don't thi I don't see Yeah .
D: Yeah , this .
D: So we targeted it ?
D: But we didn't follow the latest trends .
C: Yeah .
C: No .
C: Yeah , you could make a a front a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something .
B: I think we followed the latest trends .
D: Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer .
B: Oh right .
B: Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah .
B: You can different front uh This is a a power indicator .
D: Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh Oh yeah .
A: So Oh .
C: Like a a f banana kind of front .
D: But spongy will never be .
C: No .
D: So we give ourself a three or something .
C: Yeah .
D: Okay .
A: So that's eleven .
D: That's uh What's the average ?
C: Eleven divided by six .
A: It's Yeah , it is one point eight three .
D: A perfect score .
D: No , I don't know .
C: We're not too hard on ourselves .
C: Okay .
B: So you can see how far it's charged up .
D: And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep .
C: Okay .
B: To call .
B: Um Okay .
A: Oh yeah , that's still Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one .
D: Call That's Yeah , but it No , we need that .
C: Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too .
C: If you want to make it beep .
B: No no , I want that in .
C: But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .
D: That's usable .
C: If you do uh Yeah , okay .
D: That's really usable .
A: Okay .
B: Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?
D: It's uh Yeah .
A: So I just got a financial um You s saved it or No .
B: Yes uh .
D: I did save it .
A: Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it .
A: If I forgot anything , just say it to me .
A: It just is a battery .
A: Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list .
A: But okay .
A: So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros .
C: Mm okay .
C: But uh is uh uh Okay .
D: That's fine .
A: So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .
A: So that's both .
D: Come on , it's perfect .
D: Uh twelve point three point three .
A: Yeah , and single curved curved .
C: But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ?
A: No , that's not on the list .
A: But that shouldn't be .
B: Yeah , we can uh Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah .
A: Probably .
A: I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure .
A: See it's I think it's okay like this .
D: Special form , yeah .
A: It's hard to say .
A: But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay .
A: Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal .
B: Yeah .
A: We get different ones , that's all .
A: So you can put a recharger in it as well .
A: But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
C: Yeah .
B: This ?
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah , it's four .
D: Four .
D: It's four Euros .
B: Oh , them .
B: Is that uh included ?
D: Yeah .
B: In the twelve Euro or Okay , then we then we need to use it .
D: So we are Okay .
A: Yeah , that's included .
C: It's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards .
C: Because Sure .
A: Yeah , no .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this .
B: Damn , solar cells are uh expensive .
A: So I just want you Yeah , we just made it .
A: So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together .
A: Okay .
A: We can do some discussion about this .
A: Was there room for creativity ?
D: Yes .
B: Okay .
A: Paul , was there room for crea creativity ?
C: Beautiful .
B: Mm uh i Yeah , I think so .
B: I think uh everyone uh already .
B: So I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it .
C: Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative .
A: Yeah .
D: Or a different style .
B: So Of course there was .
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: We could make a lot of different uh remote controls .
A: Yeah .
D: So it's creativity .
C: Huh .
A: Okay , so the leadership Was there a leadership and Okay .
A: What do you have to say about that ?
C: No , I think Yeah .
D: Who was the leader ?
A: I dunno .
C: Just normal discussion , I think .
C: Not one leader or something .
B: Yeah .
B: One leader to check the time , etcetera .
C: Yeah .
C: And make notes .
A: Yeah , I know .
B: So more like a secretary .
C: Yeah .
A: Okay , next one .
A: Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard .
A: We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with .
D: Yeah yeah .
D: We were not finished .
C: Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just Yeah .
A: We're not finished .
D: Uh .
B: Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time .
B: I think that was the m biggest problem .
A: Yeah .
B: Like uh the prices .
B: If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .
C: Yeah , th that's weird .
D: Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now .
B: Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would it .
D: And then Yeah .
B: We had to Yeah .
C: Hmm hmm yeah .
A: Yeah , finance .
C: So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .
A: But the teamwork was okay .
D: Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion .
D: And uh Yeah .
B: I think uh everyone listen to each other .
C: Yeah .
B: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
A: Yeah .
A: 'Kay .
A: Yeah , what I have to say about uh means .
A: The smart board is okay .
A: Digital pen is horrible .
A: I dunno if you use it .
A: But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work .
B: It was Just doesn't work .
A: No .
B: Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well .
D: Digital pen or Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .
B: Just not work too slow .
B: Yeah , more accurate .
B: Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate .
D: Precise .
C: Yeah .
B: And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting .
A: Yeah .
B: Not just pointing out on it .
A: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations .
A: You can do it from here .
A: That's much easier than standing there .
B: Yeah .
A: And so you've Yeah .
C: Yeah , and p just point with a mouse .
B: No use to draw on the board itself .
B: It's just slows down .
C: Yeah .
C: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style .
B: Yeah .
C: But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
A: Yeah , like .
B: Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
C: And it's far too slow this way .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay .
B: You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .
C: No .
A: I think Yeah , okay .
D: Digital pen .
A: So we made it in time .
A: And we made a remote control .
B: We did it .
A: In the budget , yeah .
B: New ideas found .
D: New ideas .
C: What's that ?
B: Oh I just think if we uh I dunno .
D: For for for To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for No , for the prototype .
A: I don't know what it mean .
A: Just For remote control probably .
A: No , for the project .
B: For remote control , a favourite for your text .
C: Hmm .
D: New ideas .
C: Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this .
C: Because we don't have any sizes and Yeah , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .
A: Yeah .
A: But it's for the next team .
A: We don't have to do that .
B: That's for .
B: Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the Yeah .
C: Yeah , just brainstorming basically .
B: Details uh Quite early .
C: So are we finished ?
