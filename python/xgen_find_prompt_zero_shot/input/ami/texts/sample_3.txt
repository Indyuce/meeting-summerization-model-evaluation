D: Great man .
D: Who starts ?
A: Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting .
D: Alright , great .
D: Alright .
A: Okay .
A: I've put some uh new things in the in the map .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Uh oh .
A: This is it .
A: I don't know the shortcut , so Ah F_ five .
A: Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in .
C: Mm .
A: And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it .
D: Yes .
A: Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided .
A: But uh Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you .
D: 'Kay .
A: I think you have prepared uh all three uh ?
C: Well , yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno .
A: Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?
C: No .
D: No .
A: Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements .
D: You're the only one .
C: Oh .
D: Alright .
D: 'Kay .
A: Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions .
A: We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .
A: And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely .
C: We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ?
A: Uh Uh yeah , I think so .
C: Alright .
A: Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet .
D: Alright .
A: Um now I'll look at show this board .
A: Um Well uh notes , first meeting .
A: Now .
A: I gave a disc a a presentation .
A: Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .
A: So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls .
D: Right .
A: We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases .
C: Huh ?
A: Uh not too many one buttons .
A: One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with .
A: And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television .
C: Yeah .
A: Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .
A: It's uh one of our ideas .
A: Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it .
C: Mm-hmm , now it's right .
D: Yeah .
A: The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .
A: It should be uh recognisable at all times .
C: It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah .
B: Mm .
A: Yes .
D: Okay .
A: Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
A: And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards .
A: Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: It's quite logical al all of it .
A: Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them .
A: I got this mail from uh our bosses .
A: Well , teletext goes out .
B: Oh .
A: We will not use teletext .
D: Okay .
A: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext .
C: I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess .
A: Well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .
B: Oh .
D: Alright .
C: Oh , alright .
B: Oh , that's a shame .
A: So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
A: Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point .
A: Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .
D: Yeah .
D: But let's forget about it .
D: It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on .
A: Yeah .
A: Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products .
A: So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar .
D: Yes .
A: Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .
C: Yeah , we are a real fashionable company .
C: I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
D: Mm .
A: Yeah .
C: So it has to be uh a modern design .
A: Okay .
C: That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course .
A: Yes .
A: I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company .
A: It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics .
C: Yeah .
D: Right .
A: So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something .
B: Yeah .
A: Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations .
D: Yeah .
A: You want to start ?
D: Yeah .
D: I think I have to start .
A: Oh you have to start ?
A: I didn't see anything about uh who had to start .
D: Oh no , no problem .
C: The order ?
C: No .
A: Well s then start .
B: Mm .
D: I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry .
A: Okay .
A: Well uh You already uh opened uh PowerPoint .
D: I think it's this one .
D: But I'm not sure .
D: Hmm ?
D: Yeah .
D: S Right .
D: Yes .
D: This is it .
A: Yeah .
D: Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Um to start with these points .
D: Uh next sheet ?
D: Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things .
D: Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .
D: Um then I tell something about um the most important issues .
D: So we have to focus on those three thing three things .
D: And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .
D: Well , um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
D: That's seventy five per cent of the current users .
D: They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section .
D: Um They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls .
D: So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control .
D: Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions .
D: Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .
D: So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy .
D: Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot .
D: Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .
C: You can zap away .
D: Yeah , yeah right .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: Right .
D: A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room .
D: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily .
B: Yeah .
D: I dunno , maybe that's an idea .
A: Well It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions .
D: 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .
C: Oh .
C: Oh ?
B: Yeah .
D: So Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ?
A: So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .
A: No you can click it on your television .
D: Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
A: Yeah in another room , yeah .
D: Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room .
A: Well yes .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: Yeah .
D: So Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem .
A: Well we'll have a look at it , yeah .
D: Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn .
D: So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
C: I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course .
D: Yeah but people don't read manuals .
C: Uh I didn't read it ?
C: Oh , alright .
D: No .
B: No .
C: users to uh add one ?
C: Do you think ?
B: I don't think Yeah .
D: I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .
C: Yeah alright .
A: Yep .
C: Because they don't use it ?
C: Alright .
D: Yeah .
A: Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short .
D: Right .
D: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
B: Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
A: Yes okay .
C: Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ?
D: Alright .
B: Yeah right .
B: It sh it should be there , the manual .
B: But but not to explain how the remote works .
B: Only Hmm .
D: And we don't have much time .
D: So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design .
D: So you can pick up and use it , than I think .
A: Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point .
D: Yeah right , right .
C: Isn't it part of the of the u No .
A: So Well we'll have a look .
C: No .
C: Never mind .
D: Next point .
A: Um yes ?
D: Um R_S_I_ .
D: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought .
D: But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat ?
C: Consider the m Yeah .
D: Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote .
D: It should be a good in your hand .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: Yep .
D: Right , this is the most important part .
D: Um , we're Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience .
D: Um , that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important .
D: Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device .
D: Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that .
A: Well Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh Yeah .
D: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs .
C: It's going to be expensive .
B: No .
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah but they think it's really important .
D: So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno .
D: We have to uh Yeah , I don't know .
C: Well we'll uh consider it uh .
A: Well Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know .
C: We'll think abo we'll think No , we'll look we'll look into that later .
D: I don't have any information on that .
D: So Right .
C: Alright ?
D: And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition .
D: They also like that , but research is very uh costly .
B: I think that's uh difficult to realise also .
D: So Yeah , but it it might be important for the sale .
C: We have very demanding clients .
A: It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so We sh Yeah absolutely .
B: No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think .
D: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition .
B: Yeah .
D: So we might consider L_C_D_ screens .
C: Yeah , yeah , alright .
C: Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think .
B: No .
D: Alright .
A: Yep .
C: We don't rule them out uh yet .
A: 'Kay .
D: Alright .
D: Um , I think that's it .
D: Um I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes .
A: Alright .
A: Yes .
D: So you can Right .
A: Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation .
D: Yeah .
D: Right .
A: It's in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next .
A: You uh got uh Yes .
C: Shall I give a technical talk ?
B: Oh you go .
C: Alright .
A: Well go ahead .
C: Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .
A: Yip .
C: We have that here .
C: Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ F_ five .
A: F_ five .
A: F_ five .
C: Yep .
D: Alright .
C: Well , the working design , that's my uh Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do .
D: Next button .
C: So uh we have this .
C: It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something .
C: It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple .
D: Oh right .
D: Purple .
C: But I think you can read it .
D: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C: Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control .
D: A bit .
C: Uh well you can see uh And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page .
D: Maybe you can select it .
D: So it uh inverts .
D: the p the whole picture .
D: Nah , uh never mind .
A: Click .
C: Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult .
B: Yeah , go ahead .
C: Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works .
C: You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .
D: Yeah .
D: Alright .
C: And uh the source is of course the user .
C: Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course .
C: And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver .
C: That's the that's the basic idea .
A: Yep .
C: Very basic .
C: Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps .
C: Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key .
C: It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed .
C: The key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection .
C: uh and recognise the key .
C: So well you understand .
C: The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course .
C: And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .
C: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .
A: Yeah .
A: So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that .
A: And a button for T_V_ .
C: Ah bu Yeah , but we don't .
C: Uh we No no , but Yeah .
A: So Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves .
C: Exactly .
C: Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote .
C: I've some couple of pictures here .
C: It's a very basic one .
C: And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control .
C: It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons .
C: They're uh far enough apart and an anything .
C: It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly .
B: High tech .
C: Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape .
C: So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur .
D: Right .
D: Can I say something ?
C: Yeah .
D: Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons .
D: Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .
D: Well teletext is not an option , so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately You don't have to look and and search for them .
D: Right .
D: Make them big , make them easy to uh to press .
B: You can also like Yeah , I was thinking you can Are some of the the the um Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .
D: Right .
D: Yeah , right .
A: But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ .
D: Right .
D: Yeah , that's right .
D: That's right .
D: That's right .
C: Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course .
D: We But Yeah .
A: No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .
D: That's very important .
D: And But is that is that useable ?
B: Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ?
A: Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .
D: Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?
D: It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .
B: Well Yeah alright , but Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think .
A: Well it it's Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote Yeah .
C: Yeah .
B: Eighty per cent would .
C: Well , .
A: If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel .
D: Yeah , he feels it immediately .
B: Yeah that's true .
A: That's very irritating , I think .
D: Yeah , that's right .
D: Yeah .
B: Yeah but Mm .
A: Well .
D: Right , continue .
D: Sorry .
C: But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb .
A: No .
C: I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time .
C: Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said .
A: Yep .
C: And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Yeah , that's right .
A: That's your part of the job .
C: So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside .
A: Yep .
C: And uh well that's about it I think .
C: Oh yeah , I still have this .
C: Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh don't look at it please .
D: Alright .
A: Okay .
A: Well we understand .
D: Alright .
C: I I think it's it's clear uh how it works .
A: We understand .
D: Yeah , it's clear .
C: Alright .
A: Oh right , no .
C: That's the most important thing .
A: Nice .
C: Alright .
A: Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation .
C: Uh Right .
A: How late is did we start his presentation uh ?
D: I dunno .
D: I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ?
A: Wha Yeah .
A: Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .
D: Losing time losing time .
D: Yeah right .
D: So I don't think so .
A: So Oh yeah ?
B: Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but obviously that's not the case .
C: Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah right .
A: Uh ?
B: For instance you couldn't see this .
A: Okay , yeah well .
B: Um Yeah .
B: Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: The the method ?
B: Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .
A: Yeah .
B: Um Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer .
D: These are already in use ?
D: Alright , okay .
B: Um This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things .
B: This one is user-centred .
A: Yeah .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Um I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best .
D: Well Yeah , me too .
A: I like user-centred .
A: Yeah .
A: We also do that .
B: Um Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .
D: Mm .
B: Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one .
D: But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?
B: But Yes .
A: Yeah .
B: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel .
D: Alright .
B: Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .
D: Yeah , right .
B: I um I kinda like the shape .
B: I think this is what we talked about .
B: But No I've Well I showed it somewhere .
D: Yeah .
C: You can't really see uh the differ from different sides .
C: But I think uh Uh you can draw it if you Yeah .
B: Um Oh yeah .
B: I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front .
B: So we can can uh yeah customise the Mm ?
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company .
A: So we cannot just uh make someone w No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front .
B: Yeah .
B: It's a front .
B: It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course .
D: But it Yeah , that's right .
B: You can Mm .
A: So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .
B: Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote .
D: Yeah , that's a must .
B: So l like Ericsson does every uh S something like this .
D: We must have that .
A: Yeah , we must .
C: We can put it on the on the back side .
A: Yeah well and and Yes .
B: It's recognisable .
A: 'Kay .
D: We can make a symbol of the company right here .
B: Um Yeah ?
D: And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front .
D: So the symbol's always on Yeah .
C: Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah .
B: Yeah yeah .
A: Yeah yeah yeah .
B: Something like that , in the Yeah .
A: Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front .
D: Yeah , yeah .
C: Mm-hmm .
D: But let's not focus on the front .
B: Yeah .
A: Those kind of things .
A: Yes .
A: Okay .
B: Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function .
B: If we we had to include more functions .
B: But we don't .
B: So um Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Alright .
B: I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .
B: Maybe some less .
B: Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need .
B: I think uh Yeah , I will .
C: Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ?
C: In Map ?
B: I think uh for the remote um uh less is more .
B: The less buttons the better the design .
B: Um We should go with that concept I think .
A: Yeah .
D: Yeah , I agree .
B: I know .
A: Alright .
D: I've I've got another point .
A: Yeah ?
D: Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one .
D: Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features .
B: Mm .
D: They are high high interested in feature .
D: But they are more critical .
D: Fo Yeah , critical .
C: The younger uh Mm-hmm .
D: So The younger audience .
D: So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people .
A: Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do .
D: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually But Yeah I think m most Most uh Mm-hmm .
D: Clip aren't used much .
A: Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , but not Yeah .
D: Yeah right .
B: Yeah , but what kind of features ?
B: Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition .
D: Yeah but Yeah .
B: But I've Yeah , that's nice .
D: Here , look at these numbers .
D: The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control .
D: Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features .
D: You see ?
D: So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent .
C: Uh .
C: Yeah .
D: The concurrent ?
C: Our competitor .
A: Competitors .
C: Yeah .
D: Competitors , right .
D: So , I do think we have to uh have some features .
A: Yeah .
D: Even though they cost a little more .
A: Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote .
D: Right .
D: Right .
A: And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information .
D: Like a ticker-tape .
A: Yeah .
D: Which programme you are l watching or something .
A: Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s .
A: And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .
D: Yeah , right .
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah right .
C: Yeah .
C: So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen .
A: Yeah .
A: For example .
A: It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .
B: Yeah , we should keep that simple too .
C: But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .
B: It will No , it should be uh integrated .
A: Yeah .
D: No not clickable .
A: Well maybe .
D: Nah , no no no .
B: I think Yeah , something like on um some radios in car .
D: Yeah , just at at the top .
D: So when you s you sit like this you can can watch .
D: I think it should be at the top .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
B: You Where it's , yeah , walking to Yeah .
D: Yeah right .
D: It's a ticker-tape idea .
A: R_D_S_s or something .
C: But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing .
B: Wa Yeah .
D: Well it's just one script .
A: Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh Yeah .
D: Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming .
D: So I don't think that's the issue .
A: No .
C: Alright .
D: Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?
A: Uh well I think so , yes .
B: Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
D: 'Kay .
A: Um We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that .
D: Right , I don't know if I can find that , but Next time .
B: Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah .
A: Um we can use this board again , I think .
D: Yeah right .
A: Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue .
A: Where is my presentation ?
A: Uh Uh Well I mean we're all here now , I think .
D: Yeah , I understand what you're saying .
D: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .
A: These I've already given you .
A: So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .
D: Right .
A: So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special .
D: At the top .
C: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ?
B: At the top or at the bottom ?
A: Yes .
C: The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ?
D: I think the top is more uh When you s How do you zap ?
C: Uh Huh ?
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah but Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural .
D: You just sit in your chair ?
D: With the remote ?
A: That thing is terrible .
B: 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .
D: Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be .
A: Uh Well Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom .
D: Yeah , I dunno .
B: Yeah , no Mm .
C: And then uh Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here .
D: We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh No Um he thinks Yeah , right .
C: I dunno what uh you were talking about but we are busy with something .
D: He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top .
C: Uh-huh .
C: Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?
B: Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .
D: But your Yeah .
C: But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .
B: I c Well I d I think that's that's ugly but I th Yeah .
D: The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small .
D: It's it's wide .
D: It's not not high .
C: Uh-huh .
D: But Yeah right .
C: And and we can Bottom .
B: Power button always Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: So and and I I like to use the ones on the top .
B: Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah .
A: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window Yes but we we we we don't want that .
D: But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know .
C: Well that's a bit exaggerated .
C: Well , I agree with you .
C: It's it's also more recognisable .
D: We High-tech .
C: It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top .
B: Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote .
A: We don't want them to look like a calculator .
A: We want to look it like our original but familiar Yea Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White ?
C: Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because I think it's uh I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh it's more familiar that way .
B: Yeah .
D: Width .
A: Width .
A: Uh format yeah format ?
A: Line width ?
A: Width ?
D: Th that's not a problem .
A: Yeah ?
D: When I draw here it Oh .
D: Huh ?
A: It's a bit off .
D: Yeah , it's off .
A: Well .
C: A little a little bit .
D: It it needs to be calibrated again .
A: Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh It's special pen .
D: Well Where ?
C: Maybe you should another pen .
C: Maybe that's uh better .
C: You e you only have one pen for that screen .
C: Yeah .
D: Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time .
A: Yeah .
A: No .
D: Um I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
C: Yeah .
C: I I agree .
A: I think it should be at the button , bottom .
C: Well I'm the I I'm the designer , so um Yeah .
B: At the bottom ?
A: Bottom .
A: The L_C_D_ .
B: In a few minutes Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree .
D: At the bot So We are two uh V_S_ two .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .
B: He's the boss .
D: Right .
D: Great .
C: Uh we uh we were busy with that .
A: Because we have to decide this .
C: Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing .
A: Yeah .
C: So , we have the power button .
D: And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s .
A: Yes .
D: It's uh your it's your job .
C: Yeah of course .
C: Uh it's uh .
B: No it's our job .
C: Yeah .
A: Well we have a power button .
C: W wh While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree .
A: Guys ?
B: For all of us I think .
D: Yeah , right .
A: Guys ?
D: Alright , let's keep it central .
C: Yeah .
A: We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons Uh Yes .
B: The ten numbers ?
B: Yeah ?
C: Channel , yeah .
B: Volume ?
C: Volume control .
C: Um Well let's look at your uh design .
D: Mm .
A: Uh the mute button .
C: Uh Uh-huh .
A: I h love that one .
B: I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button ?
A: Yes .
B: Yeah , in circle , you know ?
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah yeah yeah .
A: Well that's that's also design .
B: And and a volume control also in it .
A: Yes .
D: Right .
A: Um Well h ho Yes .
C: Yeah .
C: But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something .
A: Yes .
B: Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .
A: They are for some uh video uh Apart .
C: So Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .
D: You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .
B: Yeah .
B: I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
D: Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true .
D: When when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about .
D: So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .
A: So people have to move their hand .
A: And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ .
C: Y Yeah .
A: That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place .
C: It's good to move uh from time to time .
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .
D: Um Frequency of uh button use .
A: Yes ?
B: They they need to be centred .
C: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ?
A: Well not Yes .
D: Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour .
A: Uh-huh .
B: Volume hardly .
D: You can see .
D: So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: No I don't think .
C: Oh .
A: Up and down far apart from each other ?
C: Far apart ?
D: You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ?
B: Yeah but Yeah but No .
A: Well not too much .
D: Y look at uh look at the frequency .
D: Nei not too much , but Nei nei nei n I I totally agree .
B: The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important .
B: So Well they are used four times an hour , so Power bu button should be left at the top .
C: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
A: Well for example the power button , you can If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it .
A: Because I have someone But the buttons is way .
A: So that one can be put away .
D: But just Yeah .
D: Right .
D: Yeah .
D: I agree .
A: The power button can uh be uh uh Yes .
D: And should and should be red .
C: Yeah .
A: Oh man , five minutes .
A: Yeah , well five minutes left .
D: Right , just make some decisions .
A: Yep .
D: The most important things we have to uh I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .
A: Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ?
C: C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think .
C: Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing .
A: Well I have it here .
A: Yeah well that's going to take too too much time .
D: Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready .
B: Mm .
A: Yes .
B: Yeah .
C: Mm .
A: Yes .
C: Alright .
A: Well the L_C_D_ .
A: Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface .
A: So I think it's going to go to Mike .
D: Yeah .
A: But you will have to make consensus with .
A: Well Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually .
B: Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so Alright .
D: Nei .
D: We're No We're deciding now , so Top or bottom ?
A: That's a bit uh Yes .
C: Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Yeah .
A: Yes it is .
C: You say familiarity isn't important but Yeah d Yeah .
A: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?
D: Okay .
A: Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
D: Yeah , right .
D: Okay .
A: Alright these functions .
C: As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ .
A: The number f Well yes , that's alright .
C: So that's that's enough .
D: Yeah , okay .
A: W the number function .
C: Yeah .
A: Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?
B: No .
A: How do you want it to do then ?
C: There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
B: Well just when you push a one one and No , if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it Yeah .
A: It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
C: Oh , like that .
C: Um They'd recognise it .
A: Yes .
C: Th that's the most That that's very easy .
A: Alright so no button for that .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: No .
C: Yeah .
A: Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ?
C: I think these are the the most important functions .
D: Do you still have the pictures over there ?
B: Yeah .
A: So No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh Well uh Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant .
D: Yeah , that's about it .
D: You do need the uh multi Or did uh No , like this one .
D: You do need them ?
D: Yeah , I know .
D: But are we Alright , alright uh Now okay .
D: Right .
A: So just for a television is that all we need ?
D: Yeah , it's most useable this way .
B: Yeah .
C: basic function .
A: Teletext is gone .
A: So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing .
A: We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting .
A: Uh there's um screen .
A: You can make it wider and less wide .
D: Yeah .
A: And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .
D: Right .
D: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
C: Oh yeah .
A: Those two ?
A: But it's just two , and we make a clip ?
C: Uh just two just two under uh under uh I I think uh But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section .
A: Th that's a bit uh waste .
B: We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .
A: Yes .
D: Yeah .
D: Okay , right .
A: Or at the top .
A: Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go .
B: Or at Yeah alright then .
C: Uh that's that's too complicated .
A: Yes .
C: You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom .
A: Yeah Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .
B: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah or at the top , yeah .
C: What do you think uh those those buttons ?
C: Above or down ?
C: And w where ?
C: Well we design it later .
C: We have it , and we design later where everything goes .
A: Yes ?
A: Yes .
C: Yeah .
A: Yes .
A: Well any other uh Go to video , that's always on your remote control .
D: Well if you you take those th If you Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .
B: Why go to video ?
A: To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .
C: The the video channel uh ?
B: That's just zero .
B: Yeah .
A: Well l n no not at not at my remote .
C: No no not always .
C: Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah , but you can can zap down Yes , I think th No , then you press ninety nine .
A: Yes .
A: I don't .
A: I go to ninety-nine .
D: Ah uh well whatever , .
B: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but Yeah well y you must have .
A: Th that's the button uh No .
C: But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero .
A: No you can ch push zero .
C: It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah , I I think that one button is uh I use it uh Yeah ?
D: Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ .
D: You have to set the channels .
D: Right all th these uh different buttons you have to Ah , I do .
A: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote .
C: Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width .
A: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those So we still have one uh four ?
B: Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh Yeah , alright .
D: Right .
D: That's the only one we put uh in there .
D: For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .
A: Ch ch Okay .
C: Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah .
D: Programme , right .
A: Oh the Okay button ?
D: Uh Ah .
A: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu .
C: Yeah .
A: Menu button .
C: You should Yeah .
C: I think that's important .
C: Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .
A: Channel , setting , menu .
A: We have to go .
A: Okay .
C: Channel , yeah .
A: So um Save .
C: Chief ?
C: Chief ?
A: Yes see .
C: Th the menu menu button is also important .
C: Then you can uh Where ?
A: Yes I have put it in .
C: I don't see it .
A: Here .
C: Oh Menu , alright .
B: I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .
C: In the menu .
C: And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something .
B: Yeah , the Or the volume or something like that .
C: Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu .
A: Alright .
A: Guys ?
C: Yeah .
C: Or the volume , yeah .
A: We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think .
B: Your pen .
D: Great .
A: So Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh Lunch .
C: Yes chief .
D: Alright .
B: I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ?
C: Yeah this is this is your thing .
D: Ah .
B: Yeah , lunch break .
D: Okay .
C: I am hungry .
D: Get into my belly .
A: Ah .
C: See you later mate .
