D: Bonjour .
B: It's It won't wake up .
B: Yeah .
B: I was a bit early .
B: Like What ?
D: Why ?
B: No , I just came in .
B: Uh normally I was one of them .
D: Okay .
B: Come on .
D: Check check check check .
A: Hello .
B: Why won't it wake up ?
A: Oop .
B: Is it on ?
D: The power light doesn't work .
D: You turned it off .
B: But how ?
B: Ah , there it is .
C: Okay .
A: Okay .
B: Uh .
C: I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials .
C: So I'll discuss them with you .
A: Okay , we're just going to the later .
D: Okay .
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah , I received an email as well .
A: So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .
D: Oh .
D: Hmm .
B: Which one was mine ?
A: So that's me .
A: Uh okay .
A: So Uh okay .
A: Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute .
A: What's it called , I dunno .
A: Whatever .
B: The minutes .
A: Okay , so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or Okay , we just talked about it looks .
D: Uh Shall I start ?
B: No , just tell us .
C: Mm no .
A: Has to look nice .
A: Usability is very important .
A: People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones .
A: Um It has to be very basic , not too many buttons .
A: Light switches on if you use a button .
A: Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .
A: And it has to be easy to learn .
A: That were the things I uh make minutes of .
A: And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button .
A: That are the functions .
A: That right ?
C: Yeah .
B: Yes .
A: Okay .
A: So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your Yeah .
D: No .
D: Okay well I received an email Okay .
D: I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market .
D: It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it .
D: Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel .
D: So it's very important for us to create something new .
D: So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
D: Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
D: Uh this uh aspect is the most important one .
D: Uh it came out of the research .
D: It uh is twice important as the following .
D: The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
D: Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features .
D: And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .
B: Hmm .
D: But um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .
A: But we already have the flashing flashing light on the Okay .
D: Uh maybe maybe something new .
B: Yeah , more .
D: We have to discuss about it s uh Okay , uh features not uh do not exist in current remote controls .
C: Hmm .
B: Well , I'll I'll get back on it .
D: And that's very hard I think .
D: Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use .
D: But uh that was an overall uh point .
D: We already discussed that .
D: Um I've got one picture .
D: Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
A: Yeah .
D: So I took uh that part of the webpage .
D: And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .
D: This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe .
D: But it's about uh clothes and shoes .
D: But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy .
A: Hmm .
B: Spongy .
D: But spongy , what what does spongy says ?
C: Spongy .
B: Spongy , like sponge .
D: Spongy .
D: Okay .
C: So rubber , kind of .
B: Uh soft materials .
C: Yeah .
A: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground .
B: Yeah , but Yeah .
A: So it has to be flexible .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there .
D: But I didn't knew uh knew what it means .
D: So spongy means y Yeah .
C: It's like a sponge .
B: Soft , sponge .
D: So it's also a stress-ball .
A: That's a good That's a good idea .
C: Yeah , somewhat like Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .
A: If it's de like that .
A: That's good , a good idea .
B: Yeah , but Yeah .
B: How are you gonna make it ?
A: Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ?
A: R_ soft .
D: Uh Okay ?
A: Okay .
D: What do I think ?
D: Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .
A: Yeah .
D: Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front .
D: Because it's uh it's hot .
D: And uh some basic uh colour fronts .
D: Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something .
D: Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge .
D: Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has .
D: Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah , I dun dunno .
B: Yeah .
D: We have to discuss about that .
D: Uh y yeah .
D: Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative .
D: Yeah , how do we do that ?
D: Maybe speech ?
D: We ma must have some kind of gadget .
B: Yeah , I'll get back on that .
D: So Intro Yeah .
C: Hmm .
A: It's very uh difficult to to to do it .
A: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .
D: Yeah , that's the problem .
B: Well , I got f also an email from the the technology department .
D: That's the main problem .
D: So Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .
B: They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech .
B: So they recommended using it .
A: Okay .
B: Well I'll check what they exact mean .
C: Hmm .
D: Okay .
D: Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .
B: So uh Yeah , th that's the only problem .
C: Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost .
C: But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement .
B: I d They don't say how much it will cost , so Um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .
D: Oh .
D: It's mass production .
D: So you can say , you can Yeah .
B: Since you have to uh configure speech thing .
A: But that's definitely more expensive than Yeah , but a telephone Okay , yeah .
B: Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .
D: But how uh we we're gonna make many of those .
D: So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be .
A: But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros .
B: Yeah , so uh we gotta de We have to decide on that .
A: So uh Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .
D: Yeah .
D: Okay .
D: That was this ?
B: Mm uh L_D_C_ doesn't require Okay .
C: Oh I got an email uh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced .
C: And Um They say uh a display requires an advanced chip .
C: And this is more expensive than all the other chips .
C: So it's m the most expensive .
C: Yeah , it says in the email .
C: The display requires an advanced chip .
B: And speech recognition ?
C: Yeah , probably too .
B: Advanced .
C: I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need .
B: Yeah .
B: I'll I'll give you my design .
C: If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .
B: Yeah okay .
B: So we Well we can I had uh to make a sort of a design .
B: So I did some searching on the internet .
B: I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .
B: I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .
B: I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players .
B: Mobile phones .
B: More modern .
B: Y yes .
B: Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller .
B: 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides .
B: And here you just have one , few buttons .
B: So that's that's the main difference .
B: But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this .
B: And then changeable fonts , so It's the most important part , I think .
C: Hmm .
B: But And the home base is something like that , something simple .
B: Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit .
B: Uh basic buttons .
B: On-off , mute .
B: And th maybe two others , I dunno .
A: Yeah , maybe the teletext tel No .
B: Text buttons .
B: Yeah , text button , maybe there and there .
B: And then the colour buttons , if we want it on .
B: I don't find it very usable , but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well .
D: No , I don't uh I don't like it .
C: Hmm .
B: So and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod .
B: They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four .
B: And uh f above ten .
B: And I think No no .
C: But it That's on on the display .
B: That th there is no display there .
B: But it's on the place of the display .
B: And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part .
B: So the focus is on these two parts .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
B: So you don't see all the buttons you else need .
A: But it sounds very difficult to use .
A: Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it .
B: Uh well um This is how it is now .
A: So you can't use your thumb for it .
B: Um Here uh Well we have volume .
C: I think it is on uh on the bottom too .
A: Yeah , down there .
A: But it's not not the best best .
B: Yeah .
B: Well here we have also side scrolls .
B: I dunno if we can use that .
C: Yeah , okay .
A: Yeah , for volume .
B: Do we want to use For volume ?
C: Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .
A: For volume , or a channel .
A: Yeah , why not .
B: Well then we can even simplify it more .
C: Scroll .
B: By just putting the volume on the side .
B: And and just channel buttons here .
A: And the channels as well .
A: Oh yeah .
C: Yeah , or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used .
B: But I think uh Well .
C: And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .
B: Yeah , well it's Basically it's it's here .
C: Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .
A: Yeah , that's better .
B: They're on top ?
A: Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ .
A: Put that on the button bottom .
C: Because uh you can't hold it .
B: You mean uh these to the low ?
C: You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Yeah .
A: Except from the on-off button .
B: Oh okay .
B: Well , yeah .
C: But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three .
C: So maybe we can put that on the bottom .
B: Mm Maybe .
B: I dunno , but yeah we'll Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below .
C: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .
B: It's harder to zap .
B: So I think uh it should be should be easy to .
B: I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .
C: Yeah okay .
C: That's that's good , but Yeah okay .
B: And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh you don't see 'em very good .
B: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .
B: So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .
B: But uh the position of course can be different .
B: It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .
C: Yeah .
B: So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .
C: Hmm .
C: No , I think th the the top buttons are okay .
B: Okay .
C: They sh Those should be on top .
B: Yeah , maybe Those two , yeah .
C: But uh we we can switch those two , yeah .
B: And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .
D: Okay .
B: Well that's that's my findings .
B: So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look .
B: M_P_ three player .
B: And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then .
B: I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .
C: Yeah .
B: To use So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah , that's cool .
B: Which won't look good on the front side I think .
A: Okay .
C: No .
B: So that's something we have to decide on .
C: Yeah , we have to keep it simple .
B: Yeah .
A: We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .
B: What we're gonna do .
B: Okay .
C: Okay , the component design .
C: I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .
C: So uh this was on the web site .
C: If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .
C: So flashy kinda colours .
C: Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes .
C: Not Nothing square-like .
A: Okay , so Hmm , okay .
B: Yeah well uh iPod is trendy .
B: And it is well curved square .
C: Yeah .
D: Square .
D: Like .
C: Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think .
B: Okay .
B: So not Yeah okay .
C: So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .
B: Not uh the old uh box look .
C: Yeah .
C: And um sports and gaming device style characteristics .
C: I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of looking , I think .
D: Mm .
A: Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control .
C: Okay .
B: Mm Yeah , it's Black yellow control .
A: So the colours also .
A: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .
C: Yeah .
A: Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .
C: Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .
B: Yeah , but uh I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together .
B: But Yeah , okay .
C: No , okay .
A: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .
C: That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .
B: Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ?
C: Yeah .
A: Yeah , it's cool .
B: Can we do that ?
A: Yep .
C: Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and Okay .
B: So Yes .
A: And still trans Still still transparent .
D: Oh yeah .
B: So Yeah .
B: But with all with logo on it .
A: Okay .
C: Well this is a remote control , a very old one .
C: Um Then the components .
C: The case has just a Here's black .
C: But we are making it uh Yeah , I dunno .
A: Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material .
A: Uh I'm not sure .
B: Yeah .
C: Maybe .
C: But anyways uh it should be transparent .
C: We decided that , huh ?
B: Well one of the options .
C: S Okay .
B: You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it .
B: So you can just replace them I think .
C: Yeah , we could do that .
B: That was the idea , or just uh release one .
A: Yeah .
A: Just give five with them , just in a box .
A: Five different Yeah .
B: Yeah , uh Or just uh sell different ones .
C: Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent .
C: So you can still th look through it .
B: Yeah .
A: Cool .
B: Yeah .
C: Um the buttons .
C: Normal rubber I think .
C: Like normal ordinary buttons .
B: Yeah , I uh I dunno .
C: Soft .
A: Yeah .
B: A more Yeah , just uh I think uh rubber really has an odd look .
A: It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic .
D: Uh uh Yeah .
C: With the hard hard buttons .
A: That's better prob Yeah .
C: Okay .
A: Yeah .
D: The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .
B: Yeah .
D: It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape .
D: Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um How do you say it ?
C: Yeah , it's it's all on one level .
D: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background .
C: Yeah , on one level .
D: It is in uh the c a remote control uh Yeah .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah , I know what you mean .
C: So we have to keep it on the one level .
C: Like th the top it's Yeah .
B: Yeah , like mobile phones .
B: Like uh the iPod .
B: Uh just I dunno what uh kind of material it is .
C: Yeah , okay .
C: Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic .
A: Yeah , that's cool .
C: Then the buttons ?
C: I think .
C: Or maybe Yeah .
B: But Oops .
A: But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material .
A: Just only the basic uh basic remote control from normal plastic , and the rounds of it from softer s I dunno .
C: Yeah .
C: Okay .
B: Yeah .
C: And um Then the L_E_D_ .
C: The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient .
C: And back light L_E_D_s .
A: Y Cool .
C: So But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work .
B: Yeah .
C: So if you put Okay .
A: Yeah .
B: Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah .
A: Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah , that's right .
B: Or it runs the whole Yeah , you can halfs transparent , or just that it's comes out a bit .
C: Yeah , but we can still make it transparent .
C: So Or no Yeah okay .
A: They can choose .
C: Good .
C: And in green colour , the back lights or Yeah ?
B: Different , I think , also .
A: Blue .
B: Blue or red .
D: Yeah .
B: Whatever you want it , I think .
B: Uh depends on the colour of the Yeah , that's true .
A: Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it .
D: Uh i Yeah , but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ?
A: You have to choose Is it Okay .
B: But Yeah , it can .
C: No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs .
C: So I I know I dunno .
C: Is Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive .
D: You Hmm .
B: 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .
A: Yeah , okay .
A: Maybe put some different ones in it .
A: Doesn't matter .
C: I think it's Yeah , I dunno .
A: It's just No , just some LED .
B: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone .
B: And I can change the colour of it .
A: Okay , cool .
A: Just make it some different colours .
A: Blue , red and green , or something .
C: Maybe it's too expensive , but it I th I don't think so .
B: Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet .
B: So I'm sure we can fit in .
C: Then uh some more technical things .
C: I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think .
C: Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things .
A: Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so Okay .
C: W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators .
C: There's all these kind of things .
C: Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls .
C: So I guess we j we just need that .
B: Yeah .
C: I don't know what they do or Nah , but they just said we need it .
D: Okay yeah , you can you can change Yeah .
B: Yeah okay .
B: We just Yeah , we have to make sure to uh Yes .
D: No .
C: Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .
A: Yeah , a recharger maybe .
C: Yeah okay .
C: Yeah but Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ?
A: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ?
A: Is that still the A recha Oh no .
B: Yes .
C: Accu .
B: Re recharger .
C: Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .
A: Uh Battery .
B: Base station .
A: It's just a battery .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah , batteries .
B: Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .
C: Okay .
C: Not a separate Okay .
A: No , just rechargeable batteries .
C: And uh a chip , that's this one .
C: Then uh I received some possibilities .
C: Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch .
C: So it operates on your wrist kinda .
D: Ah cool .
D: Okay .
B: So if you hold it , it gets powered .
C: If you hold it .
A: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
C: Yeah , I don't think it will work , and Or we can also use solar cells .
C: But you mostly use it indoors , so Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing .
A: It's dark in the room .
A: No .
A: It's just batteries , that's cheaper .
A: Yeah .
C: Um cases , flat , so uncurved .
C: Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back .
C: And three D_ curved is also in depth .
D: Okay .
C: So that's possible .
C: Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons .
C: So we can't use the flat buttons .
B: Mm .
B: So we need uh two D_ .
C: Yeah , I think .
A: Yeah .
A: Definitely .
C: Um these kinda materials can be used .
A: But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah , I think so too .
A: The scroll wheels , that's cool .
A: That's for the volume .
C: Yeah , scroll wheels um Yeah , that's good .
B: Yeah .
C: We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to .
C: But I think just the volume is enough .
A: Yeah .
B: Uh For channels it's not handy , because you scroll too fast .
A: Okay .
C: And uh the L_C_D_ .
C: So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .
D: Mm Uh but we have to do something about the trend .
A: I don't think that's an opportunity .
A: Just skip it .
A: Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .
C: Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip .
C: So th so the regular chip .
C: Because we use scroll wheels .
A: Yeah , okay .
B: Okay .
C: And um Yeah , that was it I guess .
A: Okay .
C: Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or We haven't decided yet .
A: Oh just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well .
A: It's No .
B: Uh I don't think a rubber case looks Yeah , okay .
C: L Yeah , i it it should be soft .
C: You said so ?
D: The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh .
B: That Uh fruit and veg , or Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .
D: And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .
D: Uh yeah i Just Just on front .
B: So you can the the spongy yeah , I dunno .
B: I can't imagine a soft remote control .
D: Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .
A: No .
B: I just can't imagine it .
C: So just hard plastic ?
A: Yeah .
C: Okay .
B: Yeah , I think .
B: Titanium .
B: It's mentioned here uh .
C: Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .
A: But maybe the form has to be a bit different .
A: Not the sh the square form .
A: Just a bit more rounded .
C: Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round .
A: Yeah .
C: But just in two D_ , not in depth .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah , that's right .
B: Okay .
A: So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these .
A: What exactly .
A: Because we have to know it .
A: So the energy uh is the recharger .
A: We already know that .
B: Yeah .
A: Just a normal battery .
B: We have batteries .
A: Okay .
A: The chip-on-print is a normal one .
C: Yeah .
B: Regular .
A: Okay , the case is just a plastic one .
C: Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one .
A: Yeah , re Yeah , regular .
C: You have the simple one , regular and advanced .
A: Yeah , okay .
C: So it's b should be regular uh the second .
A: Yeah , regular .
A: Okay .
C: I think I'll just check it .
A: And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .
B: Yes .
A: That's pretty much it .
C: Yeah .
B: User interface concept .
A: And a flashy light .
A: So uh I'm not sure .
A: But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment .
A: But Yeah .
B: I dunno either .
C: Mm .
C: Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
B: Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .
C: So we should did it here ?
A: That's for the next one .
B: So we're staying here ?
A: That's for th Uh that I think that's the next next meeting .
C: Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
C: Okay .
A: But you definitely get a specific instruction .
B: Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?
C: Yeah .
A: But th think about something that's more rounded .
A: Just And more It has to be Uh a bit .
B: Yeah , uh I dunno .
B: But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .
A: Just just on the top or on the bottom .
B: Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .
A: Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this .
A: O um if you draw it like this , you get a What the fuck is it ?
A: Okay .
A: Mm Doesn't work .
A: You see what I mean ?
A: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay .
C: What ?
C: Oh .
C: Okay .
A: Just .
A: Maybe you can make it like this .
A: And this is all the wheel for volume .
A: So that you just um It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one .
C: Like a very big scroll-wheel .
A: Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .
C: Okay .
A: Maybe , I dunno .
C: Hmm .
A: Okay , so we have this at the moment .
C: I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .
B: Yeah , you Yeah .
A: Okay , so we'd have this .
A: Is that okay ?
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah , that's a little problem , of course , as well .
C: I think it's probably better .
A: And Like this .
C: Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume .
B: Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy .
C: Only if you use your finger .
A: And uh what's the channel choose ?
A: Where do we uh put that ?
C: I think in middle .
A: Still on the bottom or That's the numbers .
B: Uh wh what is the middle part ?
C: Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .
B: Numbers , okay .
B: Yeah , I agree as well .
B: Use the dz Yeah , that's right .
A: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .
A: Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there .
A: Next to each other .
A: back and forth .
A: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty .
A: Because you have to hold it as well .
C: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .
A: But that's not want to zap very quick , so Yeah ?
B: Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority .
C: Yeah , okay .
B: And then you use those uh Yeah , of course uh .
A: Is this a opportunity , or you don't want a different Why ?
C: Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .
A: But still the next It's still the next one .
A: Doesn't make Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same .
B: Yeah .
A: It ma it doesn't make a big difference .
B: I I think it's It's it's obvious , I think .
D: Yeah , that's not not It's not al uh always the same .
A: But it's exactly th I dunno .
C: In uh On most on most remote controls .
D: Every remote control's uh different .
B: Yeah , I think No , uh I think Yeah .
C: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .
A: I You already have the volume on the side , so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake .
A: So it's uh So but that's for that's for you , 'cause it's Okay , so hmm .
B: I think it's s so simple you just Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .
C: I dunno .
C: Okay .
A: What did What else we have to discuss about ?
A: I dunno .
B: Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?
D: Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new .
D: Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control .
A: Yeah .
D: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .
A: And the LED .
B: No , you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic .
C: Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape .
C: So No , tha that will be Yeah , so top down .
B: You have to look at that image of the iPod .
D: Yes .
B: More that uh kind of style .
D: Okay .
D: And a bit uh Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ?
B: Not not the old grey black Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .
A: Uh Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: Uh the logo was has to be on there .
A: Yeah , that's right .
D: Uh five or something ?
A: Yeah , five .
D: Or more or And um uh uh buy the product .
A: Let's give five .
B: Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh Yeah .
D: You buy , you get one .
D: And uh basic .
D: Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .
B: Um I think Yeah .
B: That's your choice , I think huh .
A: So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?
A: Is that is that a good good opportunity ?
B: Yes .
A: So you could put it like that , okay .
C: Hmm ?
D: Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .
C: Do we have to design that w as well ?
D: Yeah .
A: Uh I'm not sure .
C: The docking station ?
B: Yeah , I think so .
C: Hmm .
D: Yeah , we can b It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .
B: But th Yeah , that can be very simple .
B: Least .
C: Yeah , just a recharger .
B: Yeah , just where you're around something .
B: Li Yeah , we had one example .
C: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .
B: Mm .
B: Mm .
D: Yeah , but that's a round one .
B: Which w Here you see one that's very round .
D: Maybe we can choose then .
C: Oh yeah , okay .
B: So I think that can be all kind of shapes .
A: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .
C: Of the remote control ?
A: That's all .
A: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: Yeah Yeah .
A: Just round it up .
B: Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod .
B: But More rounded .
A: No .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one .
B: Since it's This is also rounded .
A: No , just just the corners .
B: I think i Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered .
B: Mm Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .
A: Okay .
C: Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .
A: Shapes .
C: Not in depth .
C: Yeah , but Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new .
B: I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones .
B: And all curves have already been done .
A: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?
D: Yeah .
D: What do we do wrong ?
D: Hmm .
D: Just just more like this and not uh a square .
B: Yeah okay , yeah well Yeah .
D: Okay .
C: Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .
C: I would do it Like in this kind of shape or I dunno .
B: I know we can do a lot more , but I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .
D: Yeah , it Uh it's very annoying .
D: Okay .
C: I dunno if it's handy .
D: Uh Yeah .
C: This ?
B: Yeah .
C: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .
B: Yeah okay .
B: But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like .
C: Mm .
B: Curves , curves .
C: Yeah .
B: You've more there as well .
C: Yeah , okay .
B: It wasn't very small one .
C: Yeah .
B: very simple .
B: That is for elderly .
A: So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .
C: Yeah , I don't know .
B: I think if w My opinion .
B: If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look .
D: Yeah .
B: So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new .
B: No rubber buttons or something .
B: Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look .
B: More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .
C: Yeah .
A: And you have the scroll button inside .
B: Yes .
A: Okay .
B: Just a simple scrollb Doesn't have to be .
D: Yeah .
A: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ?
A: Of Skip that one as well .
A: Okay .
A: Yeah , it's cool .
C: Yeah , though that's a trend .
C: If we want to make it .
C: But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are .
C: So Spongeball kinda .
D: Uh the t the trend is spongy and fruity .
A: Rubber spongy .
D: But yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: No .
B: Spongy and Mm .
D: It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh Uh It The th th Yeah .
A: Okay , so we have s still one minute left .
A: So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .
C: Okay .
C: Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .
A: No .
A: But I I think it's still for older people .
A: You j still have older people .
A: It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever .
A: Just you have a normal But i it is it is it is already fancy .
D: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself .
C: Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .
D: It must have uh uh uh a very different Yeah , they're all the same .
B: Yeah , idea .
B: But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now And if you make it look like the iPod Yeah okay .
A: Because of the lights on the bottom of it .
A: That's already fancy .
B: So that's already a very big change compared to Ye yeah .
A: Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel .
A: Make it in in yellow or something .
A: Just like the colours of Real Reaction .
C: Hmm .
B: Well uh Could .
C: Yeah , we could do that .
D: Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .
A: Yeah .
B: No , I think Oh .
A: It's right .
B: Think the scroll wheel won't be very big .
B: Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .
A: Yeah .
B: So it will just be a small small scroll wheel .
B: So it won't uh stick out much .
A: Yeah .
A: Maybe the ones we are going to draw there .
A: Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this .
A: Because it doesn't work properly .
D: No .
A: So maybe you have to ask her .
B: Yeah okay .
B: Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .
A: Okay .
B: I'll be able to do a better job .
A: Yeah .
A: That's probably Okay , so just finish it .
D: If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here .
D: Doesn't work .
A: So we make it a bit like m that one probably .
D: Yeah , I'll see it .
A: Yeah .
A: Is that okay ?
B: Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod .
C: Yeah .
A: Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .
B: Yes .
B: Just a Speech .
B: Yeah , do we s keep that ?
B: Yeah , I think Well uh then it w Well that's very easy .
A: Or keep that ?
A: It's okay .
A: But you'd definitely need a advanced chip .
C: S Uh yeah , I don't know .
D: Uh No .
C: Yeah , I think so .
C: And we we have to build in a microphone and Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that .
B: We already have uh the beeping of the home station , so Uh strange that I received the information about that .
C: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , so Fine .
D: Oh that's hard .
D: But Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said .
A: So Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , okay ?
D: We have to be original and uh technological innovative .
D: Becau Yeah .
D: But Ma But we don't have any f information about the cost .
B: So shall we it open then ?
A: Yeah .
B: So we can put all the Okay .
A: The function of that in there .
A: Yeah .
A: And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .
C: Yeah , we probably do .
A: But it doesn't say anything about it , does it ?
B: Yeah .
C: No .
B: Oh yeah , I No .
D: We started with information about the cost was now th And how much is the chip ?
B: I just I just received the Yeah .
C: Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost .
C: But just a about the chip .
D: The the the And how how does it work ?
C: I don't know how much , but Just in inexpensive or But i it's a separate chip .
B: Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit .
B: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .
D: Is it No .
B: Doesn't say .
B: Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample .
B: Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .
A: It doesn't has to say anything .
A: Just You have to just talk to Okay , we have to stop it now .
D: Does it say does it say something back ?
B: Yeah uh th that's just It's a No .
A: So just Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult .
B: Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .
B: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .
D: Okay .
C: Yeah , I don't know anything about this , but Nah .
D: Um Yeah .
C: I dunno .
B: Well it it would be would be a good feature feature .
A: Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature .
B: Okay .
B: No no worries about the cost , etcetera .
A: We have to stop now .
A: Okay , just We have to stop it now .
B: And there's a chip in it that will Okay .
D: Fine .
