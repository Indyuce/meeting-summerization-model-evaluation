B: And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
A: Mm .
B: And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote .
B: So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it .
B: And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .
B: And uh yeah .
B: Uh Yeah , but No no no .
A: So and do they always have that ?

A: It's easy to you .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay .
B: Yeah .
A: 'Kay .
D: Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver .

### Assistant: The group is discussing ideas for a remote control for a TV, video recorder, DVR player, and satellite receiver. The goal is to make a user-friendly, original, and trendy remote control that is not too heavy, has a small number of buttons, and is not prone to breaking. The group suggests adding an LED indicator on the corner of the remote control to show when it is working. They also discuss the importance of making the remote control compatible with other devices and not using too many batteries. The group plans to have the next meeting in half an hour.
