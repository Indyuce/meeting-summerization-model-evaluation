### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So uh good morning.
<PM> Morning.
<ME> Morning.
<UI> Morning.
<ID> I see you all find your places.
<ID> Is everybody sitting on the right place?
<ME> Yep.
<ID> Yeah?
<ID> I guess so.
<ID> So Let's see.
<ID> First I will introduce myself.
<ID> I don't know if uh if everybody knows me, so I'm Bart, hello.
<ME> My name's Frank.
<ID> Hello.
<PM> I'm.
<ID> Bart.
<ID> Hello.
<ID> Hello.
<ID> Bart.
<ID> Welcome.
<ME> Thank you.
<ID> Uh let's see.
<ID> Uh let's start off um with a little presentation.
<ID> Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.
<ID> You can see there are a few cameras here.
<ID> They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice.
<ID> Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those, because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it.
<ID> So is there a project documents folder?
<ID> There are some notes in it already I see, some documents.
<ID> Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off.
<ID> Is being modified by the administrator.
<ID> Uh okay.
<ME> Hmm, that's interesting.
<ID> Let's do it read only.
<ID> Well I don't know if you've noticed, but uh we're working for Real Reaction.
<ID> Uh it's a company in uh electronics.
<ID> We put fashion in electronics, uh we make it work, uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself.
<ID> I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project.
<ID> This is our agenda.
<ID> Uh we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing.
<ID> Uh maybe I can sit down, then I can take some notes or Let's see.
<ID> Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while.
<ME> Sure.
<ID> I dunno it's not a lot of work, but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down, just write it down.
<ID> Uh as you can see uh it's the opening, aquaintance tool training.
<ID> Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit.
<ID> Um have you all seen the corporate website already?
<ME> Yep.
<PM> Yep.
<ME> Visit it.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Have you seen any flaws in it?
<ID> I think I found one.
<ID> No?
<PM> Hmm?
<ME> Can't say I paid much attention to it, but Oh yeah.
<ID> I can see if it works this way.
<ID> No, it doesn't work here.
<ID> Okay no problem.
<ID> But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction.
<ID> Real Remote is not really the company we're we are, but it's just a little fault.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Um okay, what are we going to do?
<ID> Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy, and user friendly.
<ID> So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you.
<ID> We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original.
<ID> And we've got our User Interface Designer.
<PM> Yep.
<ID> He's also uh That's about the new remote control.
<ID> Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through.
<ID> First is functional des uh design, individual work, meetings.
<ID> After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design.
<ID> I had some role indications on here.
<ID> But I think you know it already by yourself.
<ID> The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design.
<ID> Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design.
<ID> And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification, trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation.
<ID> So that's a bit what you're going to do.
<ID> But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings.
<ID> Then we've got our first tool training.
<ID> We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here, so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
<ID> As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board.
<ID> Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side.
<ID> Here are some functions.
<ID> You can save.
<ID> N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with, only undo, you can undo a little uh piece of drawing.
<ID> A blank new document for each person.
<ID> Uh select a pen, eraser.
<ID> Capture we don't have to do anything with.
<ID> Uh then we've got our pen.
<ID> This pen.
<ID> It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> You can also select the current colour and the line width.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> But then first you have to select the pen function.
<ID> But we're going to work with it in a minute.
<ID> So okay.
<ID> Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there.
<ID> Uh then a short thing about documents.
<ID> We've got our shared folder, uh project project what was it?
<ID> Project documents I think.
<ID> But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so it will be okay.
<ID> And these are available on the smart boards as well, so if you have a document you wanna show, just open it from the folder.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Here is a simple tool bar.
<ID> It's what I just said, it's save, print, move back or forward one page.
<ID> You can switch between the different drawings.
<ID> And then we're going to try out the white board.
<ID> So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal.
<ID> Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it.
<ID> Mouse wasn't running away.
<ME> That was interesting.
<ID> Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse?
<ID> No.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Innocent.
<ID> We're going to uh draw animal.
<ID> And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics.
<ID> Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours, and different line width.
<ID> Uh there's I can start from now.
<ID> I will.
<ID> You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child.
<ID> Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow.
<ID> 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up.
<ID> So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate.
<ID> Then the line width.
<ID> I think seven will be nice.
<ID> Now you'll see my drawing capabilities.
<ID> These are not very much, but uh Uh, see you have to do it real slow.
<ID> Oh Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin, but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close.
<PM> Sure.
<ME> I'm thinking about a swordfish.
<ID> So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Yeah, he hasn't got an eye.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Woah.
<ID> Now we've got another function.
<ID> We've got the eraser.
<ID> And then you can undo this easily.
<ME> Meat.
<ID> Ah it's okay.
<ID> And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics.
<ID> Uh is They've got no text tool, no.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is typically a undo action, I think.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Pen.
<ID> Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down.
<ID> I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe.
<ID> But I don't know, I'm just trying.
<ID> This is not my work, okay.
<ME> Hmm.
<ID> Maybe you have to use Oh.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal?
<ID> I don't know.
<ID> It lives for the fun.
<ID> So It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin.
<ID> It lives for the fun.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Go ahead.
<ME> Thank you.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Gonna use a different line width.
<ME> And I'm gonna draw in black.
<ME> There.
<ME> 'Kay, I'm not much of an artist, but here we go.
<ID> Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, I think.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> Because this is going a lot better than uh I did.
<PM> A sheep.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> This is my um Hmm.
<ME> Sheep.
<ID> It's nice.
<ME> With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> It's a real dead sheep, yeah.
<ME> There.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> For recognition, yeah, I see.
<ID> Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> On just a Yeah.
<ME> They are Come on.
<ME> You have to go really slow when you're writing.
<ME> They're brilliant animal animals.
<ME> And that's just a little me thingy.
<ME> So.
<ME> Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Nice.
<PM> Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head, but mm Let's see.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Uh.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Interesting.
<ID> Sweet.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> You know what that is?
<PM> Or who?
<ME> A rabbit?
<UI> Garfield.
<PM> Ah okay, yeah.
<ME> Garfield.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Just a Mm.
<PM> Guess.
<PM> So uh Yeah.
<PM> That's enough.
<PM> Um, you say a blank, or Okay.
<ID> Yeah, just a blank sheet.
<UI> Well I was gonna draw a cat too, so.
<UI> I'll just try something else.
<ID> No.
<UI> Something different than Garfield.
<UI> Mine is a bit more skinny.
<ID> Yeah, it's pretty skinny cat.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> But uh Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
<ME> And the most interesting tail.
<ID> Is your cat, or did you find him on the street?
<UI> I like cats because uh they are uh independent.
<ID> Ah.
<UI> The pen.
<UI> So.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> That's pretty clear.
<ID> So everybody knows how to work with the white board now?
<ID> So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board, just ask and go ahead.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> The pen.
<ID> It's pretty uh easy.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ID> S haunted white board.
<ME> We're being haunted.
<ID> So we've got the tool uh introduction.
<ID> We move along to the project finance.
<ID> Um as you can see, we um for our remote control, a selling price is uh twenty five Euros.
<ID> Our selling price.
<ID> Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros.
<ID> Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls, so we have to work together to reach our aims.
<ID> Uh we can do it international, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well.
<ID> Um but that's all in the later stadium.
<ID> Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros, so that's also a point we have to keep in mind, that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside, and stuff like that.
<ID> It won't work.
<ID> So just try to remember these points.
<ID> Selling price twenty five, profit aims fifty million um, but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on.
<ID> And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros.
<ID> So that's leads us to our little discussion.
<ID> We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion.
<ID> So I'm gonna sit down, I think.
<ID> It's easier.
<ME> Yeah, you got a message.
<ID> I've got a message.
<ID> Five minutes.
<PM> Five minutes, okay.
<ID> Okay, that's uh good timing.
<ME> So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
<PM> Mm?
<ID> Uh maybe you have to say the magic word.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Right.
<ID> Does it do anything?
<ME> No.
<ID> Maybe you have to just clap it down?
<ID> Mm back up again.
<ID> No slide show.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> It's off now.
<ID> It's off.
<ID> Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah.
<ID> You'll be okay, I think.
<ME> Well, it was on, but Ah, there we are.
<ID> Well it's those laptops.
<ID> Nice.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls, and I mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones?
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Like you can use for other?
<PM> Oh really?
<ID> No?
<PM> Huh.
<ID> You?
<ME> Well, we have a kind of broad TV at home, and a DVD player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
<UI> No, me neither.
<PM> It's a Sure.
<ID> Ah yeah.
<ME> And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
<ID> Yep.
<ID> Yeah I've I've got one at home.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it, and you can use it for your television, anything else.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> And it also operates on infra-red, so you have to got the little device inside your room, and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<ME> Oh really.
<ID> So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> Oh.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So that's a pretty handy um thing.
<ID> Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
<ID> It's uh That's good to remember.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Oh.
<ME> So I think you can take minutes again.
<ID> Yeah, that's nice, I think.
<ME> Since it's your job.
<ID> So we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs.
<ID> So that uh that's something we have to find out, I think.
<PM> Mm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> But that would be really good if we could do that.
<ID> And other functions for a remote control?
<ID> Maybe we can make it uh uh Shock proof.
<ME> Um.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot.
<PM> Sure, yeah.
<PM> Waterproof, or uh Uh, you never no know uh, I w I mean uh 'Kay.
<ME> So Yeah, one other little thing.
<ID> Sure.
<ID> Waterproof.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So these are our um a few things we can think of.
<ID> Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder.
<ME> Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
<ME> So you can see how much is left in the battery.
<ID> That's a battery stays.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<ME> But they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Uh.
<ME> But maybe just a little LED, I don't know.
<ID> That's an idea as well.
<ID> Other ideas?
<ID> Quick ideas.
<UI> Nope.
<UI> They were all mentioned, so Okay.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Any questions about this uh presentation?
<ID> Kick off presentation.
<ME> Um.
<ME> Nope, don't think so.
<ID> No?
<ID> Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder, and then we can all work.
<ID> Finish meeting now.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And we can all work uh on our own projects.
<ME> Aye sir.
<ID> Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour, I think.
<ME> Half an hour.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> So good luck.
<PM> Yep.
