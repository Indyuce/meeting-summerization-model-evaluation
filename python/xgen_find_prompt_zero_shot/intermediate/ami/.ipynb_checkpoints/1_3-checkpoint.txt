D: Mm .
A: Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly .
A: So , hope you have good ideas .
A: I don't .
B: I did my best .
A: Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom .
C: Not yet .
A: Uh functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera .
A: And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .
A: Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard .
A: Um uh we should take some practice .
A: I have some instructions now to do that .
D: Yeah .
A: Uh well you know how to the documents work .
A: So Uh this for toolbar .
A: You see it next .

A: And we can use this pen to perform .
C: Operations .
A: Yes .
A: So It doesn't always work .
A: Yes .
D: Yeah .
A: Okay so you can draw .
D: Draw .
A: Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera .
D: Alright .
D: 'Kay .
A: Okay ?
A: Uh Okay .
A: Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal .
A: Uh you should explain Uh with different colours and with different pen widths .
A: And you should explain why you draw that particular animal .
A: So , Julian .
B: Okay .
D: Don't take up too much space .
B: Um yeah .
C: Different pen widths , how do you do that ?
A: Uh with the format menu .
C: Oh okay .
A: And use different colours etcetera .
C: Are you serious ?
A: And what's that supposed to be ?
B: It's a giraffe .
D: Should it be one Giraffe's yellow .

D: Or so y you must save it at the end and then Okay , then m make a new one .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh yeah .
B: That's some spots .
A: I'll show you .
C: I in the file option menu .
A: Yeah .
A: In file menu .
B: No .
C: How much time do we have to draw anyway ?

C: But you get the idea .
C: It's a cat .
A: Yeah .
C: It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno .
A: Alright .
A: Okay .
C: That's it .
C: Or do I need to use more colours and Alright .
A: Yeah .
A: I think it's okay .
A: You get idea right ?
C: Yeah .
A: Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project .
A: Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros .
A: Uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros .
A: Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
A: And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
C: So we have to s Yeah .
A: Okay now it's time for some discussion .
B: Okay .
A: Uh Yeah .
B: What uh what uh do you want to discuss ?
A: We should get started .
B: Yep .
A: Uh I'm taking notes .
D: Okay .
D: Great .
A: Um we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: I didn't know if you received the same mail .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah ?
D: Yeah .
C: I guess so .
A: Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design .
C: Yeah .
A: Am I correct ?
C: True .
A: Okay .
A: Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
A: Right ?
B: Yep .
A: Yeah ?
A: And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements .
D: Yeah .
A: Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or Mm-hmm .
C: Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?
C: Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: How does the apparatus work ?
C: And well I basically had two points .
C: Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Okay .
C: And that's basically all I have so far .
A: Yeah I got another point .
A: It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .
B: Yeah .
B: Wireless uh huh .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: Alright .
C: Yeah .
D: So that's very common .
B: Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function .
B: You d you already told that .
B: And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
B: That are the the basic options for a remote control .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that .
B: Okay , yeah .
C: I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also .
B: Yeah .
B: Yep .
D: Yeah .
C: I dunno what the word is in English .
C: Uh Yeah .
A: Same I believe .
D: Yeah .
A: Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
D: Uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ?
D: So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: I mean , what functions do they have .
A: Mm .
D: Um especially what are their shortcomings ?
D: Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Um therefore we have to to do some internet search .
A: Yep .
D: For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ?
A: Yes .
D: So we can see uh what needs to be supported .
D: Um and we can interview current users and future users .
D: What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ?
A: Okay .
A: Okay .
D: Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Okay .
A: And you can get that information ?
D: I think I can get that information , yeah .
A: Okay .
A: That would be very handy .
D: So yeah .
A: Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?
D: No n not specifically .
D: More to how to get them and Yeah ?
A: No ?
A: No okay .
B: I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly .
A: Yeah ?
D: Yeah .
A: Of course .
C: Obviously .
B: Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons .
B: It has to be a small unit .
B: It has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house .
B: So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine .
A: Big , mm-hmm .
D: Yeah .
B: Uh and a and a good uh zapping range .
A: Uh what do you mean by that ?
D: Yeah .
B: Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance .
D: Yeah .
B: It has to be capable for zapping uh Yeah .
D: From the other end of the room or something ?
D: Yeah .
A: Okay um Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .
A: Um I think the best is to go to work .
C: Whoa .
C: Is that you or alright .
A: Yeah .
A: Okay .
D: Any more points to discuss ?
A: Yeah .
A: I think we can go ahead with what we have .
A: I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .
A: Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera .
A: And it seems you get more information by email .
D: Alright .
A: So that was it for me .
C: Alright .
B: Okay .
D: 'Kay .
D: Thanks .
A: Uh Yeah , in the project folder .
B: Are you going to put the the notes on the Okay .
D: Yeah .
D: The pro okay .
A: Yeah .
C: Alright .
A: I'm writing very fast .
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: Okay .
A: Hope it's readable .
D: Uh .
B: Yep .
A: Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ?
D: I guess so .
C: Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ?
B: Yeah .
B: Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?
A: Yeah .
A: Because then we have a Yeah .
B: After that we are going to the conceptual uh Okay .
D: Yeah .
D: We're just working the three phases .
A: Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting .
A: And at the end of the day we have a final meeting .
A: And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good .
C: Yeah okay .
D: Okay .
C: We'll do our best .
A: I depend on you .
D: Better make it Yeah .
C: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in .
A: Yeah ?
A: If you can mix it it's okay .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Yeah .
C: Do we I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ?
C: Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?
A: Yeah .
D: That is my question also because like new new functions Requirements .
A: Well I think that is the user requirements part .
D: Yeah .
A: As to what they want .
C: Yeah .
C: True .
A: Uh do they want all those functions on that small Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design .
D: Unit .
D: Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: I would first m Yeah .
C: So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .
D: Yeah well I I was Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices .
A: Yeah I understand .
B: I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them .
A: You can always add a few Yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video .
A: Hmm , the C_D_ player .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular .
C: Yeah so Okay .
D: And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control .
A: Yeah .
D: So with the switch , one single switch S Yeah records and stuff like that .
C: Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player .
A: Okay .
C: You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: And you you don't need that for a T_V_ .
A: Okay .
D: No .
C: And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need .
A: You need additional yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: Uh Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting .
D: In the project uh Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video .
A: And um reserve the possibility to add other features .
C: Okay .
A: So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible .
C: Okay .
B: Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly .
D: Yeah .
C: Alright .
A: Yeah .
B: So it's hasn't it's yeah .
A: Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .
B: Yeah .
B: Okay .
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
C: I understand .
D: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
A: Yeah ?
A: Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .
C: Alright .
D: Yes .
C: Yeah .
B: Can we leave now or Mm .
D: Half an hour .
A: Yeah , you're di dismissed .
C: Thanks .
D: You're fired .
A: Not yet .
D: No .
C: Alright .
A: Okay .
D: Alright let's move on .
A: Let's see what we got to do .
D: Yeah .
C: See you later .
D: Yeah see you later .
B: Okay .
A: Yeah .
B: Good luck .
A: Yeah .
A: Thank you .
D: Well good luck .


### Assistant: The text appears to be a summary of a meeting between four people discussing a remote control for a TV. They are discussing the features they want in the remote control, such as being easy to use and having a small form factor. They also discuss the possibility of adding additional features, such as the ability to switch between different channels on the TV. The Marketing Expert is asking questions about the user requirements and what the current market offers. The group is also discussing the possibility of using infrared light to communicate with the TV. Overall, the conversation seems to be focused on creating a user-friendly remote control for a TV.
