{"transcript": "<ME> It's Play-Doh.\n<ID> Play-Doh's edible.\n<ID> Did you know that?\n<ID> It's definitely Yeah.\n<ME> Because kids yeah.\n<PM> I used to eat it.\n<UI> I've, I've definitely eaten it before.\n<UI> I didn't know was edible.\n<ME> But um, it's it's made edible 'cause, yeah.\n<ID> It's it's chew proof.\n<ME> It's made edible 'cause kids eat it, and if it's wasn't edible then Well, normal babies.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<UI> Actually that makes sense, because I remember like, peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ME> Oh yeah it is, yeah.\n<ME> Oh yeah.\n<UI> Mm-hmm.\n<ID> Right.\n<ID> Everybody everybody ready?\n<UI> Yeah.\n<PM> Yep.\n<ID> Okay, let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation?\n<UI> We've got some.\n<PM> We've got a cool prototype.\n<UI> Yeah, it's pretty exciting.\n<UI> So, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use, yeah, double curved, um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market.\n<PM> Double curved.\n<ID> Nice.\n<UI> So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand, you'll see what a nice thing we have going here.\n<ME> That is cool.\n<UI> So, basically, if you hold it like that, the one on your thumb, yeah, the thumb button is the power button.\n<ID> Mm-hmm.\n<ID> Mm-hmm.\n<UI> Your index finger is channel up, middle finger is channel down, ring finger is volume up, your pinkie is volume down.\n<ME> What's the big blue thing?\n<UI> That's the lock button, has a L L on it and then the M is a mute button.\n<ME> Oh cool.\n<UI> And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want.\n<ID> what button?\n<ID> Um.\n<ME> And mute.\n<ID> Oh mute.\n<ID> Okay.\n<UI> So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available, but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different.\n<ID> That certainly does.\n<UI> So all the, I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them.\n<ID> Mm.\n<UI> So you don't you Yeah.\n<PM> Which is ant anti-RSI.\n<ID> Mm.\n<UI> It should be.\n<UI> And it's also conformable to the size of your hand.\n<UI> I mean if that's too big, it's a rubber remote, so you can, you know change that.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> 'S great.\n<ME> Oh it's so cute.\n<UI> So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah, that's good thinking, yeah.\n<ID> I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one.\n<PM> Oh right, yeah.\n<ID> But, that's I don't see why that's not possible.\n<UI> Yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> They make left-handed scissors, you know.\n<ME> Yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes?\n<UI> Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that, but I'd yeah, .\n<ID> Yes s Mm.\n<PM> Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse.\n<ID> Sure.\n<ID> Sure.\n<ME> Yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary.\n<UI> Uh-huh.\n<ME> I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah, it's not Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<PM> Imagine d are you right handed?\n<ID> Yeah.\n<PM> Imagine you're doing it with your left hand, I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah.\n<ME> Have them in stock.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ME> Make 'em more appealing as well.\n<ID> But um other than that, I mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, I think I think it's great, yeah, great idea.\n<UI> Do you think it says RR?\n<PM> I think it does.\n<ID> I think it's, well, if the RR motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable.\n<UI> Fashion to electronics.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<UI> And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue.\n<UI> Plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<PM> There you go.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<UI> So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah.\n<ID> Yeah, very good, yeah.\n<ID> It's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, all seems to be there.\n<ID> Well done.\n<ME> And all the playing around is uh Yeah, I'm just do you wanna plug in?\n<ID> Um before we move on I need that cable.\n<ME> Okay.\n<ID> Thank you.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> One thing I do need to do we need to look at, is the costs.\n<UI> The costs, was that what you said?\n<PM> Play-Doh is very cheap.\n<ID> Well, yeah.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ME> Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone.\n<ID> um Yeah.\n<UI> But it's edible.\n<ME> Mm-hmm.\n<ME> Mm-hmm.\n<PM> Chew proof.\n<ME> Well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them, .\n<UI> That was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof.\n<ID> Uh right.\n<ID> Okay, now I think we'll do this I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<PM> Oh ho-ho.\n<PM> Yep.\n<ID> And the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it.\n<ID> Ooh.\n<ID> So the case, we've gone for the double curved.\n<ID> Um and it's made out of rubber.\n<ID> The interface is push-buttons.\n<ID> And button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they?\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ID> So special colours.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ME> It's better for And special material.\n<ID> Special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff.\n<UI> Yeah, I mean, these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so The buttons are rubber.\n<ID> Yep.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> Are they made out of any special material?\n<PM> Rubber.\n<ID> No they're not.\n<ID> They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple Okay.\n<ME> Well they're rubber, aren't they?\n<PM> Yeah.\n<ID> Right.\n<ID> So let's see if that comes within budget.\n<ID> And it does.\n<ID> That is gonna cost uh Yeah.\n<ME> We're under budget.\n<ID> That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make.\n<ID> And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.\n<UI> That's cool.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> So, this is all very very good.\n<UI> And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected.\n<ID> The bosses will be very pleased.\n<ID> Okay, let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you.\n<ID> Uh.\n<ID> Save it in save it in the uh my documents.\n<ME> It's already saved, I think.\n<ID> Splendid.\n<ID> Okay.\n<ID> So uh, that's done with this with this um doodah, so you're.\n<ID> Gonna do what you were gonna do, your evaluation.\n<ME> Thank you.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ME> Oh, yeah.\n<ME> This is where we all get to I get to write on the, oops, on the board.\n<ME> Right.\n<ME> Oh.\n<ME> 'S function Okay.\n<ID> F eight.\n<ID> I love the smell of that Play-Doh.\n<ME> Mm.\n<UI> Yeah, have some have some.\n<ID> I cou.\n<ME> Okay.\n<ME> So, evaluation.\n<ME> We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria.\n<ME> I've got the criterias.\n<ME> And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria.\n<ME> And the criterias are, and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box.\n<ME> And this is false, this is just like to keep you informed.\n<ME> So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle.\n<ME> So the first criteria.\n<ME> Do you all get what we're doing?\n<UI> Mm-hmm.\n<PM> Mm-hmm.\n<ME> Okay, cool.\n<ME> Okay, first criteria, look and feel.\n<ME> So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about?\n<ME> As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy?\n<ME> So what mark should we give for that?\n<UI> Mm.\n<ID> I would give it a seven.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ME> As in it's not.\n<UI> Oh, sorry, one.\n<ID> Oh sorry, one, d yeah.\n<PM> A one.\n<ME> A one a one.\n<ME> So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one.\n<ME> Second criteria, new technology.\n<ME> Have we implemented new technology?\n<ME> As in the new high-tech So it's.\n<PM> Well, the kinetic thing, yeah.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<UI> That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new.\n<ME> So we'll give it a Yeah.\n<PM> Well so the um Yeah.\n<UI> It's ergonomic, but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah.\n<ID> Yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<PM> True.\n<ID> So on the technical side of it it Easy to use.\n<ME> I'd say it's about a a twoish?\n<UI> It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere, maybe, yeah, I dunno.\n<PM> Two.\n<ME> Two.\n<ME> Three.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<UI> Maybe three, yeah.\n<ME> three.\n<ME> So criteria three is is it easy to use?\n<ME> I think it's a one, I think.\n<ID> I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> I would give it a I would give it a two, 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but Yeah.\n<UI> Mm.\n<ME> Two, so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then?\n<UI> Okay.\n<PM> Mm.\n<UI> If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<ID> Give it a t give it a two.\n<ME> Yeah, okay.\n<ME> 'Kay, criteria four is costs.\n<ID> Cost.\n<ID> It's come in under budget.\n<ME> 's great.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> So that's a definite one.\n<UI> That was great.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ID> Amount of buttons.\n<ME> Like the amount of buttons, 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one?\n<ID> Contains only the necessary buttons.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ME> Um criteria six.\n<ME> RSI is it good against?\n<ME> Yes.\n<PM> Yes s yeah.\n<ID> So it's anti-RSI.\n<ME> Very good.\n<ME> It's one.\n<ME> And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost?\n<ME> Is it easy to get lost?\n<PM> It's yellow.\n<ID> I don't think it's gonna get lost easily.\n<UI> It is very bright, yeah.\n<ME> No?\n<ME> But it is smallish.\n<UI> It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know.\n<PM> Two.\n<UI> Maybe it will.\n<UI> Uh.\n<PM> T Mm.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ME> I think i it would, could be, could get lost.\n<UI> You think it could lost Mm.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> two.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ME> I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean, it's not a one, definitely.\n<ID> I mean it No, I mean I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but Okay.\n<UI> Okay.\n<UI> Yeah, anything, I mean.\n<UI> Okay.\n<UI> It's bigger than the average mobile, I guess.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<UI> But, yeah, it can get lost.\n<ME> The mobiles get lost all the time.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<UI> Okay, yeah, two is fine.\n<ME> But then you ring 'em and you find them.\n<UI> Yeah, yeah.\n<PM> Mm.\n<ME> So Yeah.\n<ME> So, that's that.\n<ME> So that's the evaluation, so I'd say Yay.\n<ID> Alright it's all all systems go.\n<ME> It's like like a number one.\n<PM> We've, we've done well.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ME> Um.\n<ME> Number one product.\n<UI> Mm.\n<ME> All done, thanks.\n<ID> We can't fail.\n<ME> We fitted all the criterias.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ME> Yeah, so So that's that one.\n<ID> Well done, Reissa.\n<ID> Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, you know, both individually and as a team.\n<ID> You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two.\n<ID> That's all, you know, gone very very well and and and be you know, has been good communication going on.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team.\n<ID> Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about?\n<PM> Well.\n<PM> You know It is.\n<ID> Fantastic.\n<UI> Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other RR teams, .\n<ME> been cool.\n<ID> I think So I I, you know, and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design.\n<ME> In four diff in in four meetings.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ME> Funny, all designer meetings could be this quick.\n<ID> You know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, they get Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote.\n<ME> They're using our ideas.\n<ID> Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market.\n<ID> Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us.\n<ID> But um No, I think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in.\n<UI> So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project?\n<UI> We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something?\n<ME> Yeah.\n<PM> Y Oh really?\n<ID> Or six, uh I haven't got message.\n<ME> Just start summarising now.\n<ME> You can reply to the same message.\n<ME> See summary, there.\n<ME> If you just reply to that one.\n<UI> So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted.\n<UI> It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember.\n<ME> Was it was it fifty or five?\n<UI> But there's not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit?\n<ID> It gets handed over to another department.\n<ME> Depends how much we sell.\n<UI> Uh.\n<ID> What our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically.\n<UI> Hmm.\n<ID> the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget.\n<ID> When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah, the all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah.\n<UI> But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> Yeah, that's it.\n<ID> You know, we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's does everything that we wanted it to do.\n<ME> We finished an hour earlier.\n<ID> It's new, it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already.\n<UI> I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know.\n<ME> Mm.\n<UI> We're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that, it's that it's um, hang on, I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off.\n<ME> Definitely.\n<ID> Um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new.\n<UI> Mm.\n<UI> Mm.\n<UI> Mm.\n<UI> It make watching TV healthy.\n<ID> Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the TV, you can f throw it about, you know.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ID> It's fine, it's kid proof.\n<ME> Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them.\n<UI> Uh.\n<ID> Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that.\n<ME> No.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> So all in all, I think we've done very well.\n<PM> Mm yep.\n<ID> Well done everybody.\n<ME> Yay.\n<UI> Right, you too.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> Drinks are on the company.\n<PM> Cool.\n<ID> In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to.\n<UI> Mm.\n<PM> Glad to hear that.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> That's it.\n<UI> That's it.\n<ID> Well, as far as I t as far as I know.\n<ID> Um.\n<ME> Yep.\n<ME> We haven't got the five minute left thing yet.\n<ID> No.\n<ID> Anyone wanna play I spy?\n<ME> Mm mm.\n<UI> I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence.\n<UI> Should we call the day then?\n<ID> Yeah, I guess.\n<ID> I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire.\n<UI> Uh, right.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before.\n<UI> Mm-hmm.\n<ME> In project.\n<ID> But I'm not the authority to say that it is.\n<ID> Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this?\n<ID> The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that?\n<ME> I love it.\n<ME> I love it.\n<ME> I think it's cool.\n<ME> Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool.\n<ME> Being watched.\n<ME> Um Wow.\n<UI> Your moment to shine.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> I thi you know, I'd I'd n yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before.\n<ID> something that t the whiteboard thingy, that's great.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<ID> Um, but a p a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing.\n<ID> I mean it's i or in such a new idea.\n<ID> It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff, but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<ME> Mm.\n<UI> Right, I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it's just the first step.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Mm.\n<ME> Logitech.\n<UI> I guess we should end this, since we're off off topic.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<UI> So.\n<UI> Shall we Right.\n<ME> Meeting adjourned.\n<ID> Yeah.", "summary": "The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype, the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel, technological innovation, ease of use, costs, and its ability to be misplaced. Overall, the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they we\nre happy with their product and their performance in the project."}
