The meeting discusses the development of a new remote control for TVs and other devices. The team wants to create a unique and trendy design that stands out from existing remote controls, while also being practical and easy to use. They brainstorm various ideas, such as using a whiteboard to sketch out their favorite animals and incorporating them into the design, making the remote control comfortable to hold, and including features like buttons that light up and a flat screen. They also consider the importance of making the remote control dependable and reliable, as people often take them for granted and expect them to work flawlessly. The team agrees that the remote control should have a medium-sized design and uses materials that are both durable and aesthetically pleasing.

The conversation is about the design of a remote control for a device, specifically the possibility of having interchangeable face plates. The group is discussing different ideas for how to market and sell these interchangeable face plates, including offering them as a separate item or including them as part of a set with the remote control. They also mention the possibility of creating novelty face plates with scenes from movies or other designs to keep customers interested and encourage them to spend more money. The meeting is scheduled to last for 30 minutes, during which time the group will review the design in more detail and try to formalize their ideas.
