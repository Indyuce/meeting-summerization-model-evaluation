The meeting began with the team introducing themselves and sharing their names, roles, and a little bit about themselves. Alima Bucciantini, the Industrial Designer, drew a turtle as her favourite animal, while Iain, the User Interface Designer, drew a whale. Jessy, the Project Manager, explained that the team's goal is to create a new remote control that is trendy, original, and user-friendly. The team discussed the challenges of combining multiple remotes into one and the importance of having a simple and easy-to-use design. They also touched on the idea of having separate remotes for different functions, such as a main remote with basic buttons and another remote with more specialized functions. The team agreed to look into the possibility of including video recorder functions on the remote control, but decided that it would depend on the specific product they are designing for.

The meeting discussed the design of a new product, specifically a television, and the team brainstormed ideas for its features. They agreed that it would be helpful to have larger buttons on the remote control for ease of use, particularly for older or less coordinated individuals. They also discussed the importance of considering the size of the buttons and the overall design of the remote control. The team will work on their individual tasks and then come back together to share their ideas. The meeting minutes will be emailed to everyone and the team will continue to communicate through the company website and emails.
