The meeting discussed the design of a new remote control for a television. The team presented their ideas for the remote's design, including the use of large buttons with clear labeling, buttons with illuminating surfaces, and a simple color scheme. They also discussed the importance of staying with a design for a longer period of time, rather than constantly changing it, and the need to consider the preferences of their target audience. Additionally, they touched on the topic of power options for the remote, including the use of solar cells, a hand dynamo, and kinetic power, and suggested offering different casing options such as straight, curved, and double-curved. Finally, they discussed the possibility of using a scrolling function instead of actual buttons for some of the remote's functions.

The text summarizes a conversation between a group of people discussing the development of a new remote control. They are considering various options for the remote's design, materials, and features, including the use of voice recognition technology and the possibility of producing a higher-end version of the remote in the future. They also discuss the size and type of batteries to use, with a preference for using lithium batteries due to their longer battery life and wider availability.

The meeting discussed the design of a new product, specifically the user interface and the look and feel of the product. The team agreed that they want the product to have a retro feel and to include buttons that are easy to use and have a distinct look. They also decided that the logo should be placed on the back of the product rather than on the front to ensure visibility. Additionally, they discussed the use of yellow illumination for the touch buttons and the possibility of using a clear or white number on top of a blue button to create a visual effect. The team also assigned tasks for each member, including the ID and UID working together on a prototype using modelling clay, and the PM sending an email with further instructions.
