The meeting is discussing a new remote control design project for a television. The group consists of five members:
* Maarika (Interface Designer)
* Gaurav (Industrial Designer)
* Jen (Project Manager)
* Cat (Marketing Expert)
* PM (Name not provided)

The meeting begins with an introduction of each member and their roles in the project. Maarika draws a dog as their favorite animal, while Gaurav draws a cow. Jen is from Australia and likes geckos, while Cat is not a fan of snakes. The Project Manager, PM, introduces themselves and explains their role in keeping the group productive.
The group then moves on to discussing the overall budget for the project, which is set at twenty-five Euros per remote control, with a goal of selling 50 million units and achieving a profit of fifty million Euros. The finance team estimates that production costs should be no more than twelve and a half Euros per remote control in order to reach this profit target.

The meeting attendees are discussing the design of a new remote control for a TV. They are considering various features and functionalities to include in the remote control, such as a menu-based system, buttons for specific channels, and the ability to access the TV's menu through the screen rather than buttons. They also want the remote control to be sleek and stylish, but still functional and easy to use. The attendees are also considering the battery life of the remote control and want it to have a high battery life, but not at the expense of being too far away from the usual remote controls. They also want the remote control to be user-friendly and have a small learning curve. The meeting attendees are also discussing the design of the remote control and want it to fit in with the usual stereotype of a remote control, but also be original and unique.
