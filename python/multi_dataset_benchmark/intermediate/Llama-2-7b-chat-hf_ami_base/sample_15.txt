Sure, I'd be happy to help you summarize the text! Here is a summary of the conversation:
The speakers are discussing a product they are working on for a company called RR. They mention that the product is not immediately noticeable as representing the RR brand, despite being silver and black like the company's color scheme. One of the speakers mentions that the product does not have the company's logo or color scheme prominently displayed on it. The other speaker agrees and suggests that they should go back to their own offices. The conversation ends with the speakers discussing whether or not they should take off their meeting notes.
