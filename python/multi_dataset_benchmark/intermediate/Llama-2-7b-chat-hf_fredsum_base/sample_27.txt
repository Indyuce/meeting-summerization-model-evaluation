The text discusses the topic of indemnities for elected officials in France, specifically the decision to increase the duration of indemnities for defeated deputies from 20% to 50% of their previous salary. The speaker argues that this decision is not justified, especially when many French citizens are struggling with unemployment and low wages. The speaker also mentions that the decision to improve the retirement system for parliamentarians is not in line with the current social and economic context, and that it is important for politicians to set an example and demonstrate a sense of responsibility and exemplarity. The speaker also notes that the current system of retirement benefits for parliamentarians is not fair and that it is important to review and reform this system. Additionally, the speaker mentions that Fran√ßois Fillon's criticism of special retirement schemes is hypocritical, as he himself benefits from such a scheme as a parliamentarian, and that the issue of special retirement benefits for politicians should be put on the table for discussion.
