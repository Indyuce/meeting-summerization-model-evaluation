Ségolène Royal and François Bayrou are discussing their respective economic policies and the role of the state in the French economy. Ségolène Royal argues that the state should play a more active role in securing social security and promoting competitiveness, while François Bayrou disagrees, arguing that the state should not be the sole provider of security and that the private sector should be involved in the process.
Ségolène Royal emphasizes the importance of the state in providing security and stability in the economy, citing the example of Sweden and Denmark, where the state has played a key role in securing social security and promoting competitiveness. She also highlights the need to reform the code du travail (labor law) to make it more flexible and adaptable to the needs of businesses.
François Bayrou, on the other hand, argues that the state should not be the sole provider of security and that the private sector should be involved in the process. He cites the example of Ericsson, a Swedish company that was able to reduce its workforce by 10,000 without any strikes or social unrest, thanks to the support of the state in providing security and training for workers. He also emphasizes the need to reduce the state's debt and reform the pacte presidentiel (presidential pact) to make it more inclusive and democratic.
Overall, the discussion highlights the differing views on the role of the state in the economy and the importance of finding a balance between state intervention and private sector involvement in order to promote economic growth and stability.

The text discusses the French presidential election and the candidates' positions on the topic of cautions and guarantees. Ségolène Royal, the candidate of the Socialist Party, proposes to create a public service for cautions, which would be funded by the state. François Bayrou, the candidate of the Union for a Democratic Movement, suggests that the state should not be responsible for providing this service, but rather the regions should take on this task. Ségolène Royal argues that this approach would put a burden on the state, while François Bayrou believes that it would be more effective to have the regions handle this issue.
The text also mentions that Nicolas Sarkozy, the candidate of the UMP, has described Ségolène Royal as "pugnacious" in a previous interview. Ségolène Royal responds by saying that she believes in what she is saying and is constructing her arguments with the French people.
François Bayrou then explains his position on the issue of cautions and guarantees, stating that he proposes to abolish these practices and instead make insurance mandatory. He argues that this approach would be more effective and would not burden the state.
The text concludes by mentioning that there are other themes that need to be addressed in the election campaign, such as employment and the 35-hour workweek.
