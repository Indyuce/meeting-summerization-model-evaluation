The text summarizes a conversation between two individuals, OV and Jordan Bardella, about the French economy and the European Union. OV argues that the EU has been instrumental in France's economic growth and that the country should continue to be a part of the EU to maintain its economic prosperity. Jordan Bardella, on the other hand, believes that France should leave the EU and take control of its own economy.
OV highlights the benefits of being part of the EU, such as access to a large market, increased competitiveness, and the ability to influence European policies. They also mention the success of the EU in coordinating responses to global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of working together to address common challenges.
Jordan Bardella, however, is skeptical of the EU's ability to effectively manage the French economy.

They also believe that France would be better off taking control of its own economy and making its own decisions without the interference of the EU.
