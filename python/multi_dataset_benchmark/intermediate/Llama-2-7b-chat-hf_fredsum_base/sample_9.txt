Clémentine Autain, a former member of the French National Assembly, stated that she does not think the debate on the burkini is a priority, as there are more pressing issues facing the country. She believes that the extreme right, including some members of the Rassemblement National, are using the burkini debate as a way to distract from more important issues such as the erosion of the social safety net and the rise of Islamophobia.
Gabriel Attal, a member of the National Assembly and spokesperson for the Republicans party, disagreed with Autain, stating that the burkini debate is not a distraction, but rather an important issue that needs to be addressed. He believes that the law passed in 2004, which bans the wearing of conspicuous religious symbols in schools, is not enough and that more needs to be done to protect the values of the Republic.
Jordan Bardella, a member of the National Assembly and spokesperson for the Rassemblement National, also disagreed with Autain, stating that the burkini debate is not a priority and that the left is trying to distract from more important issues. He believes that the law passed in 2004 is sufficient and that the left is trying to create a problem where none exists.
In summary, Clémentine Autain believes that the burkini debate is a distraction from more important issues, while Gabriel Attal and Jordan Bardella believe that it is an important issue that needs to be addressed.
