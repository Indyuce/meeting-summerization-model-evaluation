Marine Le Pen believes that the European Union is not the solution to France's problems, and that the country should focus on creating its own tech companies instead of relying on American or Chinese ones. She thinks that the EU's regulations are often too burdensome and that the country needs to be more innovative and take risks in order to compete with other global players. Emmanuel Macron, on the other hand, thinks that the EU is essential for France's economy and that the country should work together with other European countries to create a strong digital market. He also believes that the EU can provide a level playing field for French companies to compete with American and Chinese tech giants.
