M. Jospin and M. Chirac are discussing the issue of social housing in France. M. Jospin proposes to increase the number of social housing units, improve access to housing for low-income families, and provide more support for homeowners who are willing to rent to modest households. M. Chirac disagrees with these proposals, arguing that they will not solve the problem of social exclusion and that the current system is flawed. He suggests that the focus should be on creating more jobs and improving the overall economy to address the root causes of social inequality.

Summary:
In this conversation between Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin, they discuss the issue of housing and property in France. Chirac criticizes the socialist government for not doing enough to address the problem of affordable housing, particularly in Paris, where there is a shortage of affordable housing and a surplus of luxury apartments. Jospin defends the socialist government's policies, arguing that they have made significant progress in increasing the supply of affordable housing and reducing the number of people living in poverty. Chirac accuses the socialists of not doing enough to address the problem of speculation in the housing market, and of prioritizing the interests of the wealthy over those of the poor.
Chirac also raises the issue of immigration, arguing that the socialist government has not done enough to address the problem of illegal immigration and to integrate immigrants into French society. Jospin responds by pointing out that the socialist government has made significant progress in reducing unemployment and improving the economy, which has helped to reduce the number of immigrants coming to France illegally.
Overall, the conversation highlights the differences between the socialist and conservative parties on issues of housing and immigration, with the socialists emphasizing the need to address the needs of the poor and vulnerable and the conservatives accusing them of being too focused on social welfare and not enough on economic growth and law and order.
