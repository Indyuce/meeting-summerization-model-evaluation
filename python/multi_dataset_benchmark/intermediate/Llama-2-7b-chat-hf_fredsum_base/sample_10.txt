Jordan Bardella and Gerald Darmanin are discussing the French pension reform proposal. Jordan Bardella suggests that the reform will lead to people working longer before retiring, while Gerald Darmanin argues that the current system is unfair and that people should be able to retire at the age of 62 with a decent pension. Darmanin provides an example of his mother, who worked hard and deserves to retire at 62, but the current system would not allow her to do so. Bardella responds by saying that the example is unrealistic and that the number of annuities is not always mentioned in the discussion. Darmanin counters by saying that the reform will cost 9 billion euros per year and that the part of the budget dedicated to pensions will stabilize in the long term. Bardella then asks Darmanin how he plans to finance the reform, and Darmanin replies that he will have to work longer to make up for the lost time. Bardella suggests that Darmanin is trying to deceive the public and that the truth needs to be told.
In summary, the conversation is focused on the French pension reform proposal and the potential impact on the retirement age and pension benefits. Darmanin argues that the current system is unfair and that people should be able to retire at a reasonable age with a decent pension, while Bardella suggests that the reform will lead to people working longer and that the number of annuities is not always mentioned in the discussion.

The speaker, Jean-Baptiste, is discussing the French retirement system and the proposed reform by the government. He is arguing that the current system is unfair and that the government's plan to raise the retirement age to 65 will only exacerbate the problem. He believes that the government is not prepared to handle the situation and that their plan is a form of "sacage social" (social disaster).
The speaker is particularly concerned about the impact of the reform on young people who start working early and will have to work longer to reach the new retirement age. He uses the example of an infirmiere who starts working at 21 and will have to work an additional 45 years to reach the new retirement age of 65, while a financial executive who starts working at 23 will only have to work an additional 43 years. The speaker argues that this is unfair and will lead to a significant decrease in the standard of living for these individuals.
The speaker also criticizes the government for not having a clear plan and for relying solely on the retirement age increase to solve the problem. He suggests that the government should engage in a more comprehensive approach to address the issue, including discussions with social partners and other political projects.
Overall, the speaker is opposed to the government's retirement reform plan and believes that it will have negative consequences for young people who start working early.
