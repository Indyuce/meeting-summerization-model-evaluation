The text appears to be a conversation between several individuals, including Bruno Retailleau and Eric Zemmour, discussing the French right-wing party and its internal dynamics. Here is a summary of the main points:
* Bruno Retailleau mentions that the party needs to be "re-raised" (pour relever la droite française) in order to give a perspective to France.
* Alain Poher (AP) responds by saying that when things are unclear, there is always a wolf (quand c'est flou, c'est qu'il y a un loup).
* Eric Zemmour (EC) agrees with Retailleau and adds that the party's internal democracy is important (ce que je voulais dire, c'est que c'est primaire privée, fermée). He also mentions that the party's calendar should be respected (on ne va pas perturber les élections sénatoriales) and that the party's democracy should be strengthened (ensuite, ce que je veux dire, c'est que c'est les militants).
* Retailleau responds by saying that the party's internal democracy is not the same as the Chinese Communist Party's (on n'est pas en Chine). He also mentions that the party's last word should be respected (le dernier mot).
* Alain Poher then interjects to clarify that the party's method of functioning is not the same as the RPR's (ce n'est pas la Chine, c'est un parti que tu n'as pas connu). He also mentions that the party's internal debates are important (il n'y aura pas ces débats).
* Eric Zemmour concludes by saying that he is proud of his time in the party and of alerting the French people to the party's abandonment of sovereignty (j'étais fier de militer, j'étais fier d'alerter les Français sur les abandons de souveraineté).
