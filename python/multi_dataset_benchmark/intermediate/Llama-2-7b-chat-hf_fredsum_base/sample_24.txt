The inflation rate in France is currently around 4-4.5%, but it is expected to increase to 12% in other European countries. To address this issue, the government has proposed several measures, including reducing the TVA (value-added tax) by 20% to 5.5% for certain basic necessities such as food and energy. Additionally, the government plans to eliminate the TICPE (fiscal burden on energy) tax, which was introduced by Emmanuel Macron when he was Minister of Economy. This tax increase will be compensated by a reduction in the litre price of fuel. The government also plans to reduce the price of electricity and gas by 15% to 30%.
However, the opposition party, led by Marine Le Pen, has criticized these measures, arguing that they will not help the poor but will instead benefit the rich. They propose to reduce the TVA by 20% to 5.5% for all basic necessities, not just energy and food. They also plan to eliminate the TICPE tax and reduce the price of fuel, electricity, and gas.
Gerald Darmanin, the Minister of Action and Public Accounts, has stated that the government's measures will help the poor and middle class, while Marine Le Pen's proposals will only benefit the rich. He has also highlighted the potential consequences of Le Pen's policies, such as the possibility of the French economy collapsing and the poor and vulnerable suffering as a result.
In response to Le Pen's claims, Jordan Bardella, the spokesperson for the National Rally party, has argued that the government's measures will not address the root causes of inflation and will only provide temporary relief. They propose a more comprehensive approach to addressing inflation, including reducing the TVA for all basic necessities and increasing the minimum wage.
Overall, the debate between the government and the opposition party centers around the best way to address the issue of inflation and how to support the most vulnerable members of society. While the government focuses on targeted measures to help the poor and middle class, the opposition party proposes more comprehensive reforms to address the underlying causes of inflation.

The text discusses the economic policies of Jordan Bardella, a French politician, and their potential impact on the population. Bardella argues that the current government's policies have led to a decrease in the purchasing power of the French people, with many struggling to make ends meet. He claims that the government's focus on reducing the deficit has resulted in cuts to social welfare programs and an increase in the cost of living, which has disproportionately affected the poor and vulnerable. Bardella also criticizes the government's handling of the economy, suggesting that they have been too focused on reducing the deficit and not enough on addressing the underlying issues that have led to the current economic situation. He proposes a number of measures to address these issues, including increasing the minimum wage, reducing the cost of living, and investing in social welfare programs. Overall, Bardella's message is that the current government's policies are not working for the majority of the French people and that change is needed to address the economic challenges facing the country.
