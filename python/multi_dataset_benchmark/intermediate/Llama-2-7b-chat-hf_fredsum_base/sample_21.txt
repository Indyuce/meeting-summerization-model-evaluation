Jordan Bardella and Gérald Darmanin were interviewed on a French television show to discuss the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia. Here is a summary of their exchange:
Jordan Bardella: "The situation in Ukraine is very serious, and we must be very clear about it. The images that have been seen are terrible, and they are not just images of war, but also of crimes against humanity. We must not hesitate to condemn these crimes and hold those responsible accountable."
Gérald Darmanin: "I understand your position, Jordan, but I must correct you. The French government has not voted on all of the sanctions against Russia. We have voted on some of them, but not others, and that is a matter of principle."
Jordan Bardella: "I see. Well, I think it's important to be clear about our position on this. The French government has a responsibility to protect the interests of the French people, and that includes standing up for human rights and condemning crimes against humanity. We cannot be silent in the face of such atrocities."
Gérald Darmanin: "I understand your concerns, but I must remind you that the French government has been working closely with the international community to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Ukraine. We have been involved in diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis, and we will continue to work towards a peaceful resolution."
Jordan Bardella: "I appreciate your efforts, but I think it's important to be clear about our position. The French government cannot continue to support a regime that is committing such heinous crimes against the Ukrainian people. We must take a stand and condemn these crimes in the strongest possible terms."
Gérald Darmanin: "I understand your position, but I must remind you that the French government has a responsibility to protect the interests of the French people, and that includes maintaining good relations with Russia. We cannot isolate ourselves from the Russian economy and risk damaging the French economy."
Jordan Bardella: "I understand your concerns, but I think it's important to prioritize human rights and moral integrity above economic interests. We cannot continue to support a regime that is committing such atrocities and expect to maintain our moral authority in the world."
Gérald Darmanin: "I understand your position, but I must remind you that the French government has a responsibility to protect the interests of the French people, and that includes maintaining good relations with Russia. We cannot isolate ourselves from the Russian economy and risk damaging the French economy."
