Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen were asked to summarize their plans to address the recent scandal in elderly care homes (EHPADs) in France. Macron first mentioned that his government has already taken steps to address the issue, including investing 20 billion euros over five years to improve the conditions for patients and staff in EHPADs. He also mentioned that he would reintroduce 15,000 dismissed soignants and restitute their salaries. Le Pen criticized Macron's plan, stating that it was too little and too late, and that she would invest 10 billion euros in the first year to address the issue. She also proposed to introduce a mutualist model for EHPADs, where the state would provide funding and the families of the residents would be involved in the management of the structures. Macron replied that he would not wait for a crisis to act and that his plan was developed before the recent scandal.

Emmanuel Macron's speech centers around the theme of caring for the elderly and addressing the challenges faced by the healthcare system in France. He proposes to invest 50,000 additional staff in the healthcare sector, including nurses, caregivers, and doctors, to improve the quality of care for the elderly. He also plans to develop a new system for home care, which would provide financial support to families caring for their elderly relatives. Macron emphasizes the need to address the issue of staff shortages in the healthcare system and to provide more hours of work for caregivers. He also proposes to increase the retirement age progressively to 65 years old.
Marine Le Pen criticizes Macron's plan, arguing that it will lead to a increase in the national debt and that the money should be used to support the French people rather than being spent on foreign aid. She also questions the feasibility of Macron's plan to increase the retirement age, arguing that it will be difficult to implement and that it will lead to a decrease in the quality of life for the elderly.
Gilles Bouleau interjects to clarify that Macron's plan is not just about increasing the retirement age, but also about improving the quality of care for the elderly and addressing the staff shortages in the healthcare system. He also highlights the importance of investing in the healthcare system to ensure that it can provide quality care for the elderly.
Overall, Emmanuel Macron's speech focuses on the need to invest in the healthcare system to provide better care for the elderly and to address the challenges faced by the system. He proposes a comprehensive plan to improve the quality of care and to provide more support to families caring for their elderly relatives. Marine Le Pen, on the other hand, is critical of Macron's plan, arguing that it will lead to an increase in the national debt and that the money should be used to support the French people rather than being spent on foreign aid.
