The text discusses the French pension system and the proposed reforms to increase the retirement age from 60 to 67. The speaker, Olivier Veran (OV), explains that according to current statistics, 43% of people today are retiring at the age of 60, while 44% of French workers are expected to retire at the age of 67. The speaker also mentions that 42% of people who retire today are unemployed, which is seen as an injustice.
Cadre (JB) adds that the current retirement age is not sustainable and that the government needs to act to address the issue. He explains that if a cadet (young professional) works for five years more than an infirmary worker or an unskilled worker, they will have to work one year less to reach the retirement age.
OV responds by pointing out that the statistics are not accurate and that there is a mistake in the calculation. He explains that the actual number is not 42%, but rather 43% of people who retire today are unemployed. He also highlights the issue of seniors losing their jobs at the age of 55 and the lack of investment in their training and reintegration into the workforce.
OV suggests that increasing the retirement age to 67 will allow for more investment in the training and development of seniors, which will lead to more job opportunities and a more sustainable pension system. He concludes by saying that this is what economists are saying and that it is important to listen to their opinions.
