* Introduce a "contract initiative employment" to help long-term unemployed workers find jobs.

M. Jospin:


* Propose a "contract for employment" that would reduce the working time for employees and give them more flexibility.
* Increase the minimum wage to reduce the number of low-paid jobs and encourage businesses to hire more workers.
* Reduce the number of working hours for employees to increase their leisure time and reduce the burden on the healthcare system.
* Invest in education and training to improve the skills of the workforce and make it more competitive.
* Introduce a "green jobs" program to create jobs in the environmental sector.
* Increase the number of apprenticeships and vocational training programs to provide more opportunities for young people to enter the workforce.

Jospin's approach focuses on reducing working hours and increasing investment in education and training to improve the skills of the workforce and create more jobs.

In summary, Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin are discussing the French economy and employment. Chirac expresses concerns that Jospin's policies will lead to a decrease in productivity and job creation, as well as an increase in taxes and government spending. Jospin argues that his policies will help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promote job creation, particularly in the fields of environment and social services. He also proposes a reduction in succession duties for SMEs and a more selective approach to tax credits. Chirac questions the feasibility of Jospin's proposals and raises concerns about the potential impact on the economy and employment.

The speaker is discussing the issue of reducing working hours in order to create more jobs and increase productivity. They argue that the current system of long working hours and high unemployment is not sustainable and that something needs to be done to address this issue. They propose a gradual reduction in working hours, starting with a reduction of 600 francs per month, which they believe will incentivize employers to hire more workers without qualifications. The speaker also mentions that they have a plan to create 400,000 jobs over two years through a combination of government funding and negotiations with employers. They believe that this approach will be more effective than simply reducing the working week without considering the broader social and economic context.
