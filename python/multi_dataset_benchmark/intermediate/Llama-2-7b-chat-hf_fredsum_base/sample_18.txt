The text discusses the topic of the Euro and the French presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon's stance on it. Henri Guaino, a political advisor and former member of the French National Assembly, is interviewed and shares his thoughts on the matter. He explains that he is against the Euro and believes it has led to a loss of sovereignty for European countries, particularly France. He also mentions that the current system of the Euro is not sustainable and that it is not in the best interest of the people.
Guy Verhofstadt, a former Prime Minister of Belgium, is also interviewed and expresses his disagreement with Mélenchon's views. He argues that the Euro has saved Europe from a financial crisis and that returning to national currencies would be a mistake. He also notes that the European Central Bank has already taken on a role beyond its initial mission and that the Euro is already a strong currency.
Mélenchon is then given the opportunity to respond and he reiterates his stance on the Euro, stating that he would consult the French people on the matter of keeping or leaving the Euro and that he believes the current system is not in the best interest of the people. He also mentions that he is not against the idea of a strong Euro, but rather against the current system of the Euro which he believes is not sustainable.
