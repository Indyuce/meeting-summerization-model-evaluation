In summary, the speaker is addressing the Minister of Finance and criticizing their policies on nationalizations and the revaluation of the franc. The speaker argues that the Minister's policies are not in line with the constitution and the great tradition of republicans, who believed that when a single person controls a market or a product of national value, the nation should take control. The speaker gives the example of the Dasault aviation company, which is being supported with public funds despite being owned by a single person, and argues that this is not logical or fair. The speaker also mentions the plan calcul, an ordinateur that is being subsidized, and suggests that the state is helping various economic activities, including the construction of naval vessels and civil aviation, because if it did not, these activities would not be able to develop. The speaker concludes by stating that they find it critiquable that these policies serve the interests of a single person.

The text discusses a hypothetical presidential candidate's (FM) proposed plan for the French economy, specifically regarding the nationalization of certain industries. The candidate is criticized by another character (VG) for their plan, which is seen as reactionary and failing to address the needs of the French people. VG argues that the candidate's plan would not provide any real change or hope for the French people, and that it would only serve to maintain the status quo. VG also points out that the candidate's plan would not provide any incentives for innovation or growth, and that it would instead rely on outdated methods of governance.
Some key points from the conversation include:
* FM proposes to nationalize certain industries in order to "respect the rules of the game" and to ensure that the French economy is "not left to the whims of foreigners."
* VG argues that nationalization is not the solution to France's economic problems, and that it would only serve to harm the economy in the long run.
* FM responds by pointing out that the current economic system is unfair and that the French people are not seeing the benefits of their hard work.
* VG counters by saying that the problem is not with the economic system, but with the way it is governed.
* FM argues that their plan would provide real change and hope for the French people, while VG argues that it would only perpetuate the status quo.
* VG also points out that the candidate's plan does not provide any incentives for innovation or growth, and that it would instead rely on outdated methods of governance.
