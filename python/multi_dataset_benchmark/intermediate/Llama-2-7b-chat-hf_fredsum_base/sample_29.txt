Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron are discussing the proposed 35-hour workweek and the potential impact on the French economy. Marine Le Pen argues that the proposal will lead to a "race to the bottom" in terms of wages and working conditions, while Emmanuel Macron believes that it will promote flexibility and adaptability in the labor market. They also discuss the potential impact on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the need for a more flexible and adaptable labor market.
Marine Le Pen: "The proposed 35-hour workweek will lead to a 'race to the bottom' in terms of wages and working conditions. It will be detrimental to the French economy and will not create any new jobs."
Emmanuel Macron: "I disagree. The proposed 35-hour workweek will promote flexibility and adaptability in the labor market. It will allow businesses to adapt to changing economic conditions and will create new job opportunities."
Marine Le Pen: "But what about the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? They will be unable to compete with larger companies that have more resources and will be forced to lay off employees."
Emmanuel Macron: "I understand your concerns, but I believe that a more flexible and adaptable labor market is necessary to promote economic growth and job creation. SMEs will be able to adapt to changing economic conditions and will be able to compete more effectively in the global marketplace."
Marine Le Pen: "But what about the workers? They will be the ones who will suffer the most from this proposal. They will have to work longer hours to make up for the lost time and will have less job security."
Emmanuel Macron: "I disagree. The proposed 35-hour workweek will actually lead to more job security for workers. Businesses will be able to adapt to changing economic conditions and will be able to provide more stable employment for their employees."
Marine Le Pen: "I don't think so. The proposal will lead to a 'race to the bottom' in terms of wages and working conditions. Businesses will be able to exploit workers more easily and will not provide them with the same level of benefits and protections."
Emmanuel Macron: "I understand your concerns, but I believe that a more flexible and adaptable labor market is necessary to promote economic growth and job creation. The proposed 35-hour workweek will actually lead to better working conditions and higher wages for workers in the long run."
Marine Le Pen: "I disagree. I believe that the proposal will lead to a decline in the French economy and will not create any new jobs. I will not support it."
Emmanuel Macron: "I understand your position, but I believe that the proposed 35-hour workweek is necessary to promote economic growth and job creation in France. I will continue to work towards its implementation."
