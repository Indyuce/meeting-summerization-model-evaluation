In this debate, Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron discuss their methods for reducing taxes and increasing purchasing power. Emmanuel Macron proposes methods to make budget savings in order to reduce taxes for businesses and households by 40 billion euros and 10 billion euros, respectively. He also suggests abolishing the housing tax. Marine Le Pen rejects the possibility of increasing purchasing power through Macron's proposed methods due to the increase in the CSG (contribution sociale généralisée), which would make retired people pay more.
Marine Le Pen proposes reducing taxes by 10% for the first three income tax brackets, reinstating the 50% tax bracket for widows and widowers, defiscalizing overtime work, reducing the price of gas and electricity by 5%, increasing the value of small pensions, and increasing the APL (allocation pour les parents d'élèves) for young people by 25%. She wants to finance these proposals through a social contribution on imports.
Emmanuel Macron argues that Le Pen's proposals have no way of being financed, not even the reduction of EU charges, which she falsely claims to be 9 billion euros, or immigration.
