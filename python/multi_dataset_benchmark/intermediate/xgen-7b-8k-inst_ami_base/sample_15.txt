A group of people are discussing the development of a TV remote control. They have decided on the energy source for the remote, which will be a basic battery or a hand dynamo (used in the 1950s for torches). They also discuss the possibility of using kinetic energy, such as gently moving the remote with your hand, as an alternative energy source. They also consider using solar cells, but note that it might not be practical indoors. They discuss the possibility of using a double curved case for the remote, and decide that rubber push-buttons would be the best choice for the case material. They also consider alternative options for the push-buttons, such as a scroll-wheel or advanced chip with integrated infra-red sender. They decide that the sample sensor, speaker, and speech recognition options are not practical for their remote control product.

The team is discussing the design and functionality of a new remote control for a TV. They have decided on a few key features: it should have a simple layout with general buttons, it should have a power button, and it should have a spinning wheel like the one on the side of an iPod. They also discussed the idea of using a remote with a rubber case, but decided that it would not be feasible due to the lack of a cover function. They also discussed the importance of the look and feel of the remote, and decided that it should be fancy and technologically innovative.

The text describes a meeting among individuals from different departments of a company, discussing the development of a new product. They discuss the design and features of the product, as well as how it will be marketed and sold. The meeting touches on various aspects of the product, including its color options, user interface, and potential lock key facility. The participants also discuss the potential for the product to be a source of profit-sharing for the company. The meeting ends with the participants agreeing to keep working on the product and to hold off on any questions until the next meeting.
