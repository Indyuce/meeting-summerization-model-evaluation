The meeting is a remote control design project. The team consists of a User Interface Designer, a Industrial Designer, and a Project Manager. They are working on a three-stage design process, which includes whiteboarding, user testing, and finalizing the design. The team is discussing their backgrounds and interests, including music, TV shows, and food. They are also discussing their roles in the project and how they will work together.

The finance department has discussed a project to develop a universal remote control for a TV. The remote will need to be able to control TVs with different formats (NTSC, PAL, etc.) and be sold for a profit. The designers are tasked with creating a design for the remote that is universal and easy to use. The initial ideas discussed include a touch screen design, a PDA-style design, and a design that uses a pen interface. The designers are encouraged to think about what the user wants and what features the remote should have. The project is expected to be profitable if it can be sold for a certain amount.
