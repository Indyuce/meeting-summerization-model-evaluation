After the meeting, the remote control's components will be discussed. The whiteboard will be used to present the insides of a remote control, with the circuit board, chip, LED device, button, and various batteries being discussed. The company has made different types of batteries, including simple, dynamo, kinetic energy, and solar cells. The remote can have a flat or curved shape, and it can be curved on both sides or have one-sided curves. The remote can also have different shapes, such as a fluffy remote or a remote with a kinetic energy case. The company has made different types of buttons, including push-buttons and scroll wheels. LCDs are also an option, and the company has recently made a sample sender and speaker. The user interface and marketing aspects will also be discussed.

The discussion revolves around trends in the market for remote controls, including the preference for technology and innovation. The group agrees that voice recognition, LCDs, and spinning are important features for the remote control. They also discuss the importance of style and ergonomics in the design of the remote control. The group also briefly discusses the possibility of using rubber or wood for the case of the remote control.

The text describes a meeting among a group of people who are discussing ideas for a new remote control for a TV. They are considering various components, such as buttons, scrolling, and a spinning wheel. They also discuss the use of rubber and the possibility of incorporating the colors of the company into the buttons. They consider using solar energy but decide against it due to the constraints of using rubber. They also discuss the use of voice recognition and advanced integrated circuits. In the end, they come up with an overall concept for the remote control, which will be made of rubber, have push-buttons on the outside, an LCD with spinning wheel, and incorporate voice recognition.
