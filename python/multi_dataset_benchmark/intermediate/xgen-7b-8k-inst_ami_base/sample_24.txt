A group of people are discussing a prototype for a remote control device. They mention that they have opted for a simple design with large buttons for primary functions and two volume buttons, but also have a slide-out panel for more advanced functions. They also mention that the remote has a voice recognition feature and a touch screen, but decided against using those features in the final product. They discuss the cost of the product and whether or not to worry about rot factors. The meeting ends with the decision to go with a more durable rubber coating instead of a new polymer.

A group of people evaluated a product they designed, discussing their personal opinions and ideas. They discussed the aesthetic qualities of the product and the ease of using it. They also talked about the limitations of the product and the need for further research. The group also discussed the budget for the product and the possibility of expanding it to include more features. They also talked about the importance of considering the needs of the target audience. Overall, the group had a productive day and were satisfied with the progress they made.

The group discusses their limited ability to think outside the box and the project evaluation. They mention the project's success and the need for extensive marketing to make it a success. The group also discusses the need for more slides and the incorporation of tin foil from a random Kit-Kat bar. The meeting ends with the group discussing the need to evaluate the product rather than the project in general.
