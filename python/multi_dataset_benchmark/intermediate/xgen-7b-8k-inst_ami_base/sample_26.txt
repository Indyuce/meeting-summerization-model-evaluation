The meeting is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. The speakers have presented their research on user requirements and technical functions. They have determined the user requirements and technical functions, and are now discussing the design of the remote control. They are considering the number of buttons, the type of buttons, and the design of the remote control. They are also considering the inclusion of speech recognition technology.

The group is discussing the new product requirements for a TV remote. The only non-functionality is the company color and logo, which is needed to be included on the remote. The target group is older people, but the product should be user-friendly for all ages. The specific functions of the remote include changing the channel, turning on and off the TV, and sending messages to the TV. The remote should have a low number of buttons and be easy to use. The group also discussed the need for a homing device and speech recognition, but it is not clear if these features will be included in the final product.
