The meeting is about the design of a new remote control for a television. The functional design objectives are to keep in mind user requirements, design effects, and working design. The agenda includes three presentations: one on market research, one on voice recognition, and one on RSI. The presenter mentions that people are frustrated with losing remotes and that the current remotes are not matching their operating behavior. The focus should be on the buttons that people use the most, such as changing the channel and volume. The presenter also mentions that there is a lack of feedback on the design of the remote control.
