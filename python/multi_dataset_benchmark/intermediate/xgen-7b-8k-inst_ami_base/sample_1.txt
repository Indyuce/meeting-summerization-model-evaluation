A group of people are meeting to design a new remote control. They discuss their favorite animals and what they would like to suggest for the design. They also discuss the project finance and how the remote control will be sold internationally. They consider the cost of the remote control and how it might appeal to different markets. They also discuss the possibility of adding extra functionalities to the remote control.

The meeting discusses the design of a product, with the industrial designer focusing on the actual working design, the user interface designer focusing on technical functions, and the marketing executive focusing on requirements and fulfilling them. The functional design stage is next, and the meeting ends. The group was given an example of a coffee machine, and it is up to them to decide whether to focus on television features or have a unique selling point. The main factor in production cost is considered.
