The meeting discusses the design of a new remote control for a television. The company has decided that teletext is outdated and that the remote control should only control the television, not the VCR or DVD. They also want the color and slogan of the company to be incorporated in the design. The company prefers a simple design, but the presenter suggests asking for preferences for more advanced functions that can be hidden in a drawer. The meeting concludes by discussing the priorities for the design, with a focus on customer needs and the company vision of fashion in electronics.

The meeting discusses the development of a remote control for a TV. The company wants the remote to be attractive and sleek, and to appeal to people who like the aesthetics and ergonomics of the products. The company also wants to group the different functions of the remote together, so that it doesn't just look like a big panel of controls. The company is considering whether to include speech recognition in the remote control, and they discuss the potential appeal of the technology to people with physical disabilities. They also consider the cost of including speech recognition in the remote control and whether it is worth the investment.

The meeting discussed the development of a technology product, focusing on the user interface and components. The goal is to create a modular system with basic functions such as power, transmitter, and receiver. The user interface can be split into components for different functions, such as voice recognition, and can be added or removed based on user needs. The transmission between the remote control and TV was discussed, with the possibility of restricting to traditional technologies like infra-red to simplify the process. The controller's power was also discussed, with the possibility of including a charging unit or using regular batteries. The meeting concluded with a recap of the product's aim and functions, and a suggestion to categorize the controls into three simple categories.
