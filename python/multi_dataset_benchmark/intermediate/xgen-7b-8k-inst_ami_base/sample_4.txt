After a meeting to discuss the design of a remote control, the group decides to focus on a basic design with no LCD display, no need for talking back, and a kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons and maybe backlighting for the buttons with internal LEDs to shine through the casing. The slogan will be included, but not in a visible way. The group discusses the size of the remote control and decides on a basic design with a simple button layout and no advanced functions. The group also discusses the cost of the remote control and decides to use a basic design with kinetic power and battery, no LCD display, and rubber buttons. The group also discusses the possibility of using an advanced function and decides to keep it hidden from the user.

The text is a discussion among four people, PM, UI, ID, and ME, about a project evaluation. They discuss various aspects of the project, including the design, the look and feel, the control features, and the cost. They also discuss the use of a remote control and the color of the design. The discussion ends with the group deciding on a rating for the project.
