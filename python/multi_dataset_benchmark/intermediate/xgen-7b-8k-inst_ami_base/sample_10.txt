The meeting focuses on the design of a remote control for a television. The goal is to identify the main components of the remote control and how they work together. The design process will be cyclical and incorporate feedback from the marketing and user interface departments. The remote control will only be used for television and will have a simple, clear design. The company wants to incorporate color and a slogan into the design. The goal is to keep the design simple and clear while incorporating advanced technology to keep the remote control up-to-date.

A usability lab conducted a survey to gather feedback on remote control usage and preferences. The survey found that people are not happy with current remote controls, with seventy-five percent of users finding them ugly. The most annoying thing about remote controls is their lack of functionality, with users spending more time trying to figure out how to use them than actually using them. Current remote controls are not well-suited for the way people use their TVs, with most users only using ten percent of the buttons and finding it difficult to switch between channels. The survey found that people prefer a remote control with a lot of buttons, but that most buttons are not used. Voice recognition and LCD screens were also deemed unpopular.

The text describes a meeting among a group of individuals who are working on a project. They discuss various aspects of the project, including the design of a remote control for a TV, the use of voice recognition technology, and the development of a beeper button to help locate the remote control. The group also discusses the target audience for the remote control, which they plan to design for people between the ages of 15 and 35. They plan to incorporate a number of key buttons and a menu button, as well as voice recognition as an option. The group also discusses the importance of keeping the remote control close to the user to make it easy to use.
