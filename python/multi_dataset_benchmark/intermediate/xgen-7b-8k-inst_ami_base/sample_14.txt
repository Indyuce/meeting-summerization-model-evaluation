The meeting is about the development of a remote control for a television. The presenters are Catherine, Gabriel, and Reissa. Catherine presents the design for the remote control, including its energy source and the sender for the signal. The signal will be sent to the television using an electronic chip controlled by the user interface. The signal will be an infra-red signal that will be sent through walls if needed. The idea is to make the signal strong enough to reach the television from another room. The presenters discuss the possibility of using Bluetooth instead of infra-red, but decide to keep the idea as a possibility. They also discuss the need for a volume control, channel keys, a numerical keypad, and a mute button. They also discuss the need for a lock function and the possibility of using a physical switch or cover for the remote. The presenters also discuss the need to keep the corporate image within the remote control unit, and the possibility of making the remote control units fashionable.

The text describes a group of people who participated in a survey about remote controls. The majority of respondents (75%) found the remote controls to be ugly, but they would spend more money on a remote control if it looked cool and fancy. The current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user, and many respondents (72%) said they only use a few of the buttons on the remote. The remote control often gets lost in the room, and the older generation (45-55 year olds) did not want a voice-activated remote. The younger generation (25-35 year olds) were more interested in a voice-activated remote. The manufacturing cost of the remote control may be affected by wrist strain injury from repetitive use. The group decided to go with a basic television remote that is safe to use, looks cool, and is cheap. They also discussed using infra-red or Bluetooth as the energy source and using special long-lasting batteries.
