A group of people are meeting to discuss the design of a new television remote control. They discuss the importance of making the remote control original, user-friendly, and attractive to consumers. They also discuss the need for the remote control to be able to pick up signals from anywhere and be able to switch between different channels without having to contort their bodies. The group also talks about the physical appearance of the remote control, including the need for it to be comfortable to hold and have buttons that are easy to find. They also discuss the possibility of adding lights or other features to the remote control.
