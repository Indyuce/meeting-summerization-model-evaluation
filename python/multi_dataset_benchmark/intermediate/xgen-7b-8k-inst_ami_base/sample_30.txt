The meeting of the design group is discussing the design of a remote control for a television. The management has placed new requirements on the group, including the removal of teletext and the incorporation of the company logo and colors. The group is also considering incorporating voice recognition for the remote control. The meeting discusses the functionality requirements from a research lab, including the importance of channel and volume settings and the low relevance of some buttons, such as audio settings. The group also discusses the possibility of removing some buttons altogether and incorporating speech recognition instead.

The text is a discussion about a remote control for a television. The participants discuss the design of the remote, including the number of buttons, the shape, and the placement of the buttons. They also discuss the need for a user-friendly interface and the possibility of adding a locating device to the remote in case it gets stuck under a couch cushion. The participants also mention the possibility of using a rechargeable battery or a battery that lasts for up to 10 years. They also discuss the possibility of using a different type of energy source, such as a magnetic field or a cordless phone base.

The group discusses the possibility of incorporating voice recognition technology into a television set. They agree that the only necessary buttons are channel control, volume control, and on/off. The discussion also touches on the need for the set to incorporate the corporate logo and color scheme. The group agrees that they will consider only the television and not DVD players. The head office has specified that the project is limited to television only, and the group will give further thought to this for the next meeting.
