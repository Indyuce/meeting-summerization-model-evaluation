The meeting discussed the functional design of a new remote control. The team presented their findings, including the results of user research, which showed that users are not satisfied with current remote controls. They want a remote that is simple, yet high-tech looking, and can be easily used by a wide range of consumers. The team also discussed the importance of including speech recognition technology, which allows users to say channel numbers or other commands, and the remote will respond. The meeting also covered the design of the remote itself, including the size of the on-off button, the selection button for various entertainment devices, and the smart chip that will allow for universal application and skipping between devices. The team also discussed the power source and the switch between the power source and the rest of the remote.

The meeting discussed the design of a remote control for a television, with a focus on simplifying the layout and including only the most essential features. The group agreed to eliminate unnecessary buttons and combine some functions, such as play, fast-forward, and rewind, into a single button. They also decided to include buttons for volume, mute, and channel up and down, as well as a menu button for accessing additional settings. The meeting also touched on the topic of including audio settings, such as mono and stereo, and screen settings, such as brightness and color, but it was decided that these could be accessed through the television itself.
