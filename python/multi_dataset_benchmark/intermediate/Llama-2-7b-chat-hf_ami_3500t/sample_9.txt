The meeting began with the introduction of the participants, followed by a brief overview of the project. The group was asked to introduce themselves and share their favorite animals, along with their roles in the project and how they relate to those roles. The discussion then turned to the agenda for the meeting, which included a review of the project plan and the identification of the components of the remote control. The group also discussed the budget for the project and the target profit of fifty million Euros.

The meeting attendees are discussing the design of a new remote control for a TV. They are considering various features and functionality, such as making it sleek and stylish, user-friendly, and original. They also want to include features that are not commonly used on most remote controls, such as a menu-based system or a single button for accessing a menu. They also want to prioritize battery life and avoid a steep learning curve for new users. The meeting attendees also mention that they will receive specific instructions after the meeting to help them move forward with the design.
