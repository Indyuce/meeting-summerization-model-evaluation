The meeting discussed the design of a remote control for a TV, with a focus on simplicity and fashion. The group brainstormed ideas for the remote's design, including using a curved or double-curved case, incorporating pushbuttons or a scroll wheel, and considering the use of a kinetic battery that would charge through movement. They also discussed the importance of keeping the design simple and easy to use, with a small number of essential functions and a menu system for accessing advanced features. The group also considered the use of an LCD display for accessing additional features.

The text discusses the design of remote controls and the preferences of users. The main points include:
* The importance of aesthetics and fashion in remote control design, according to a recent market investigation.
* The preference for functional and easy-to-use remote controls, with a focus on simplicity and intuitive design.
* The potential use of innovative materials, such as fruits and vegetables, or spongy materials, to improve the grip and comfort of the remote.
* The idea of using a round remote instead of the traditional vertical design, to make it easier to use with one hand.
* The potential benefits of using a wheel-like design for channel flipping and a separate button for volume control.
* The possibility of using an LCD screen on the remote to display information, but the potential difficulties in practice.
* The preference for seeing the text and information on the remote control, rather than on the TV screen, when adjusting settings.

The group discussed the design of a remote control for a television, specifically the shape, materials, and features such as buttons, scroll wheels, and on-screen menus. They considered the options of using a simple or regular chip, and decided to go with a simple chip for now. They also discussed the user interface design, including the placement of buttons and the use of a scroll wheel or pushbuttons. They decided to go with pushbuttons for now, but may consider a scroll wheel in the future if necessary. They also discussed the use of a curved or double-curved case, and decided to go with a curved case. Finally, they mentioned that they will work together on a prototype using modelling clay in their next meeting.
