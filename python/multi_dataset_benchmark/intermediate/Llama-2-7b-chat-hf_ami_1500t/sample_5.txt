The group is discussing the development of a new remote control for electronic devices, with a target price of â‚¬25. They want to make it unique and attractive, with a focus on design and shape. They also want to consider the size and weight of the remote, as well as the materials used to make it. The group is divided into subgroups to research different aspects of the remote control, including competition, design, and materials. They will meet again in half an hour to share their findings and move forward with the project.
