The text describes a meeting where a team of designers and engineers are discussing the development of a new remote control for a television. They have created a prototype with large buttons for easy use and a slide-out panel for more advanced functions. The remote also features a voice recognition system and interchangeable faces, including a "fruity" option. The team is considering the materials and design of the remote, as well as its durability and ease of use. They also discuss the possibility of making the remote edible in the event of an earthquake or other disaster.

The text describes a meeting where a team of designers and engineers are discussing the development of a new remote control for a television. They are discussing the design and features of the remote, including the use of a new type of polymer, the inclusion of voice recognition technology, and the possibility of adding additional skins or covers. The team is also discussing the cost of the remote and the finances of the project.

The conversation revolves around a project to create a new remote control for a television that incorporates voice recognition technology. The team is considering whether to include a solar cell in the design, which would make the remote more environmentally friendly, but would also increase the cost. They discuss the potential compromise of removing the solar cell and instead focusing on the voice recognition feature as the main selling point. The team agrees that this is the best option in order to stay within budget.

The team is discussing their experience with a new product development process, specifically the use of a new pen and paper for note-taking. They are evaluating the effectiveness of the process and providing feedback on their satisfaction with the product. Some team members are disappointed with the loss of a solar panel feature, but overall, they are pleased with the product's performance and the team's productivity. They also discuss the potential for future improvements and the importance of creativity in the development process.

The group discussed their experience with a recent project where they were divided into teams and given a task to complete within a limited time frame. They used Play-Doh as a creative tool to help them come up with ideas and solutions. The team found the project to be creative and fun, with good teamwork and leadership. However, they also noted that there were some issues with the level of information provided and the lack of colours available, which limited their creativity. They also felt that the project could have benefited from more collaborative brainstorming and planning sessions. Overall, the group had a positive experience and found the project to be a good learning opportunity.

The team discussed their recent brainstorming session and how they felt under-stimulated throughout the meeting. They mentioned that they were not given much freedom to think outside the box and were more focused on completing the project's requirements. They also talked about how they initially felt more pressure to come up with ideas, but as the meeting progressed, they became less invested in the outcome. The team leader expressed that they were not sure what the de-briefing would entail and were curious about what new ideas would be presented. They also discussed the limited ability to think outside the box and how it affected their creativity.

The group discussed their experience with the product design project, where they were tasked with designing a new product for a company. They shared their thoughts on the project, including their initial confusion about the brief, their design process, and their final presentations. They also discussed their observations on the other groups' presentations and their own experiences with the project. The conversation touched on topics such as the importance of marketing, the potential success or failure of their product, and the role of psycholinguistics in understanding filler words and phrases like "um" and "ah."

The text describes a meeting between several people, including an artificial intelligence assistant (AI), a project manager (PM), and a user interface (UI). They discuss the internet and how it has become an integral part of their lives, with the AI mentioning that it has only been around for 18 years. They also talk about the different ways they access the internet, such as broadband and modems, and how it has become ubiquitous. The meeting ends with the AI thanking the others and signing off.
