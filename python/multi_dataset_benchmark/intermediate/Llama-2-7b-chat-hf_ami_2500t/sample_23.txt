The meeting discussed the design of a remote control for a television, with a focus on incorporating new and innovative features. The team discussed various options for the remote's design, including the use of different materials, such as wood or leather, and the possibility of incorporating visible light signals. They also considered the use of a touch screen interface and the importance of making the remote easy to use. Additionally, the team discussed the limitations of their current manufacturer and the possibility of looking to other manufacturers for more options. The meeting ended with a discussion of market trends and the team's desire to create a remote control that is both functional and visually appealing.

The team is discussing the design and features of a new remote control for a television. They are considering various options, including a touch screen interface, voice recognition, and a durable design. They are also discussing the cost of production and how to balance the price with the features they want to include. The team is considering using a new manufacturing option to potentially reduce costs.

The conversation revolves around deciding whether to include a touch screen or voice recognition feature in a new remote control design. The team discusses the pros and cons of each option, considering factors such as cost, market research, and the potential for battery issues. They ultimately decide to prioritize voice recognition due to its lower risk and potential for faster market entry. The team also brainstorms alternative design ideas, including a round remote control that could potentially be sleeker and more aesthetically pleasing.

The team is discussing the design of a new remote control for a TV. They have decided to focus on a simple, non-remote design with a few primary functions and a voice command feature. They are considering using a rubber material for the outside case and have ruled out a touch screen due to cost constraints. They want to incorporate menu buttons and a slide or compartment for more complex functions. They are also considering using different case colours for different users. The team is assigned tasks to work on the design and prototype, including working on the basic look and feel, laying out the simple design with voice recognition built in, and checking product evaluation with pilots. They are to use prototype building materials and specific instructions will be sent by their coaches. The team members feel clear about the project and are ready to move forward.
