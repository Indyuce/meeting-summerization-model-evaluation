The meeting discussed the design of a remote control for a TV, specifically the look and feel, user interface, and advanced functions. The remote control will have a snowman-shaped design with no LCD display, no need for talk-back, and will be powered by batteries. The buttons will be rubber and have backlighting with internal LEDs, and there will be a jog-dial and slogan on the device. The advanced functions will include power on/off, channel skipping, volume control, and access to settings such as brightness, contrast, and color. The designers will determine the specific advanced functions and the user can define them. The meeting also discussed the sound settings, which will include basic, mid-range, and high-range audio, as well as balance and pre-programmed sound modes.
