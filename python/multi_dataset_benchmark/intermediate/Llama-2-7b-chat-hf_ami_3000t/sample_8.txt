The text summarizes a meeting where a group of people discussed the design of a new remote control. They looked at three different prototypes and provided feedback on each one. The main points discussed include:
* The group liked the design of the first prototype, which was based on a banana shape, but they noted that it would not stand on its own and would need to be flattened to save money.
* They also liked the second prototype, which had a more traditional remote control shape, but they noted that it was too curved and would be expensive to produce.
* The third prototype was based on a tomato shape, but the group did not like it as much and thought it was not as ergonomic as the other two prototypes.
* They discussed the issue of the shift button being stuck on one of the prototypes and how to fix it.
* They also talked about the cost of producing the remote control and how to save money without sacrificing quality.
* Finally, they decided to fire the accountants and add some new features to the remote control design.
