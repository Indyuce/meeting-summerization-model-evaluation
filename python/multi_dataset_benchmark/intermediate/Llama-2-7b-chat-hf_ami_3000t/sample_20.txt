The meeting discussed three prototypes for a new remote control design, each with unique features and button layouts. The group evaluated the designs and provided feedback on their preferences for feel, functionality, and aesthetics. They also discussed the possibility of adding an extra button for an on/off function and decided to conduct a product evaluation using a set of criteria. During the meeting, some members expressed a preference for the "potato" prototype, which has a simple and intuitive button layout, while others liked the "rhombus" prototype, which has a more ergonomic shape and a unique button layout. The "Martian" prototype was also discussed, but it was noted that it might be more challenging to produce due to its creative design. Overall, the meeting provided a thorough evaluation and discussion of the remote control prototypes, allowing the group to make informed decisions about the design and functionality of the final product.

The design of the remote control is rated as follows:
* Ease of use: 2 (it's a bit hard to learn at first, but once you've learned how to use it, it's easier)
* Technological innovation: 3 (it doesn't have any particularly unique or innovative features)
* Fancy look and feel: 3 (it has a unique design, but it's not extremely fancy)
* Functionality: 1 (it's functional, but not extremely functional)
* Ease of learning: 4 (it has a high learning curve, but it's easy once you've learned how to use it)
* Matches appropriate behaviour: 1 (the design does not particularly match the appropriate behaviour, as people don't use a lot of buttons and the menu system can be confusing)
* Spongy quality and made of latex or rubber: 1 (it has a spongy quality and is made of latex or rubber, which is a nice feature)
* Integration of fruits and vegetables: 0 (it does not integrate any fruits or vegetables)
* Corporate colour: 1 (it matches the corporate colour)
* Silvery kind of white or something: 0 (there is no mention of a silvery kind of white or something)
* RR inscribed on the bottom: 0 (there is no mention of an RR inscribed on the bottom)

The group discussed the design of a remote control for a television, focusing on various aspects such as simplicity, fashion, and cost. They also evaluated the project's creativity, leadership, teamwork, and the use of digital pens and whiteboards. The group achieved most of their design goals and came up with a finished project, but could have benefited from more information on certain design elements. Overall, the group felt that they did well given the information they had and were satisfied with the project's outcome.

The group worked together to create a remote control using fruits and vegetables as inspiration for the design. They used different colors of clay to create prototypes and discussed how the buttons might work and how to improve the design. They decided to market the remote as the "mango remote" and found that using a whiteboard for brainstorming ideas was helpful, but having individual notes was also important. They were able to make firm decisions at the end of each meeting and found that the meetings were well-managed.

The text describes a meeting where the participants discussed the design of a remote control for a TV. They discussed various ideas, including using a GPS system to locate the remote, making the remote walk by itself, and adding slides to a PowerPoint presentation. They also talked about the color scheme for the remote, with some preferring yellow and grey, while others preferred grey. The meeting ended with the participants feeling that they had not made much progress on the project.
