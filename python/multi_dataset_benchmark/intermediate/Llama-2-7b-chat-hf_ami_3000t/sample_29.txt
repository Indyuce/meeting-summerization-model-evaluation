The meeting begins with the team leader, ID, introducing the project and outlining the goals of creating a new remote control for TVs and DVD players. The team members share their thoughts on the current remote controls available in the market, including their complexity, lack of style, and uncomfortable design. They also discuss the importance of making the remote control original, trendy, user-friendly, and affordable.
The team members then share their personal preferences for the design of the remote control, including the use of a whiteboard to brainstorm ideas. Kendra suggests using a duck as her favorite animal, while PM chooses horses. ID mentions that they want to sell the remote control for €25 and make a profit of €50 million.
The team leader then asks the members for their thoughts on the physical appearance of the remote control, including the use of buttons, flat screens, and concave buttons. They also discuss the possibility of adding light-up buttons, like those found on mobile phones.
Finally, ID asks the team members if they have any thoughts on how to market the remote control, especially given the already existing competition in the market.

The meeting discusses the design and marketing of a new remote control for a living room device. The team brainstorms ideas for the industrial design, including a medium-sized remote control with interchangeable face plates, and a focus on dependability and practicality. They also consider marketing strategies, such as offering the remote control in different colors or creating novelty designs with scenes from movies. The meeting is scheduled to continue in 30 minutes to further discuss and formalize these ideas.
