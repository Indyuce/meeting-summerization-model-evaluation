The meeting discussed the evaluation criteria for a new remote control, including ease of use, fashionability, feel good factor, technological innovation, and cost. The team agreed to use a seven-point scale for each criterion and individually rate their opinions. The average score for the prototype was around two, with some members giving higher scores for ease of use and technological innovation, while others gave lower scores for fashionability and cost. The team also discussed the importance of including a squishy and fruity design, which was given a score of two. The meeting concluded with a review of the Excel spreadsheet for cost estimation, which showed that the remote control would likely cost under â‚¬12.50 if the planned components were used.

In summary, the group discussed their experience with the project, including the limitations imposed by the company, the lack of creativity, and the challenges of working together as a team. They also discussed their ideas for the product, including the desire for it to be fashionable and technologically advanced, and their thoughts on the potential marketing strategy.

Sure, here's a summary of the text in one paragraph:
The team has completed the project and the costs are within budget. They will now finalize the questionnaire and meeting summary before hosting a party to celebrate their achievement. The team members express their gratitude to the Project Leader for their hard work and collaboration.
