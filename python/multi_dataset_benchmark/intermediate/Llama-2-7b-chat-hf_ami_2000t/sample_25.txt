The meeting is being led by Mandy, the Project Manager, who is introducing the team to the new product they will be designing - a remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The team will work together to create a project plan and discuss their individual roles and responsibilities. They will also brainstorm ideas for the remote control and its features. The meeting begins with an icebreaker activity where the team members are asked to draw their favorite animal and share its characteristics. The team then discusses the selling price and profit aim for the product, as well as the production cost per remote. The team leader, Mandy, encourages the team to share their thoughts and ideas on the project, including their experiences with remote controls and their first ideas for the new remote.

The text discusses the design and functionality of a universal remote control. The group of people in the meeting agree that the remote should be compatible with a wide range of devices, and that the design should be ergonomic and visually appealing. They also discuss the importance of including features such as programmable buttons and a user-friendly interface. The meeting attendees also consider the size and battery type of the remote, with a preference for a thinner design and double A batteries. The meeting ends with a summary of the main points discussed and a reminder that more specific instructions will be emailed to the attendees soon.
