The group is discussing the development of a new remote control for electronic devices, with a target price of â‚¬12.50. They are considering various features and design elements, such as color, shape, and size, as well as the inclusion of unique gimmicks like a whistle function. They are also looking into the competition in the market and the available prices of other remote controls. The group is split on the size of the remote control, with some preferring a larger, more feature-rich design and others advocating for a smaller, more compact option. They will reconvene in half an hour to continue their discussion.
