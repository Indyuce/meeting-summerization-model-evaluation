The text discusses the topic of social justice and the proposed reform of pensions in France. It mentions that the current retirement age is 65 for both men and women, but the government is considering increasing it to 67 for both genders. The text also mentions that the government is considering a clause that would allow for a revoicing of the project in the future if the system is deemed equitable. The text also mentions that Emmanuel Macron's proposal is for a minimum pension of €1,000 per month for all French citizens, and that this would be funded by new taxes on the wealthy and large corporations. The text also mentions that Marine Le Pen proposes a minimum pension of €2,000 per month, which is more generous than Macron's proposal. The text ends by stating that the choice between the two proposals is a social one and that the best solution would be to find a balance between the economic and social aspects of the reform.

The speaker discusses the injustice of a proposed pension model that requires people to work longer to receive the same level of pension as those with higher education and professional backgrounds. They point out that this model unfairly disadvantages those who work in lower-paying jobs, such as nurses and manual laborers, and that it is not based on factual data. The speaker also mentions that the model does not take into account the fact that some people may lose their jobs due to retirement, and that this could lead to a decrease in investment in the future of these workers.
