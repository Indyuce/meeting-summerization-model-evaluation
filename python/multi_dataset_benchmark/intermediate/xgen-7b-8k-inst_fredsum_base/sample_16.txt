Ségolène Royal and François Bayrou engage in a debate about the direction of the French economy and the role of the state in economic policy. Royal presents her vision for a new economic model, based on competitiveness, innovation, and a focus on creating jobs, while Bayrou criticizes aspects of the plan, particularly the state's role in providing unemployment benefits and social security. The debate touches on issues of economic growth, the role of the government, and the importance of dialogue between citizens and politicians.

SR, who is not identified as a specific person, discusses the presidential pact and its modernity. The pact is not a state-led agreement but rather a partnership between the government and various stakeholders, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to implement economic and social reforms. The pact includes a new contract and a new agreement with SMEs to end uniform aid to all businesses, which will provide assistance to those in need, such as growing businesses and innovative businesses. The pact is not a 60 billion euro project but a 35 billion euro project that will create jobs and promote sustainable growth. The new growth model is called sustainable growth, and SR hopes to achieve it with a large majority.

P1 asks about the quality of Ségolène Royal, and SR responds that when she has the floor, she is very assertive because she cannot be stopped. P1 also mentions that there is a difference in approach between the two candidates. SR argues that the state should not be involved in the solution, but rather, the regions should provide a guarantee for cautions and deposits of guarantees. She also mentions that the regions have already experimented with this approach and that it is a partnership between the public and private sectors. P1 asks about the 35-hour workweek, and SR emphasizes the importance of a partnership between landlords and tenants. The regions have successfully implemented this approach by providing a guarantee for cautions, which helps to advance the cause of affordable housing.
