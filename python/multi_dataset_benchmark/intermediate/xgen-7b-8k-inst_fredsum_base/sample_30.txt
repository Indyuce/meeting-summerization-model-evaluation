In a debate, Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron discuss their methods for reducing taxes and increasing purchasing power. Emmanuel Macron proposes methods for making economic savings in order to lower taxes for businesses and households. He proposes to save 60 billion euros to lower the deficit by 40 billion euros and 10 billion euros in taxes and charges for businesses. He also proposes to eliminate the housing tax. Marine Le Pen rejects the possibility of increasing the purchasing power method proposed by Emmanuel Macron due to his increase in the CSG, which would make retirees pay more. Marine Le Pen proposes to reduce taxes by 10% for the first three tax brackets, restore the half of the widow's and widower's share, de-fiscalize overtime hours, reduce gas and electricity prices by 5%, revalue small pensions, increase APL by 25% for young people, and universalize family allowances. Emmanuel Macron states that these proposals cannot be funded and that they cannot be financed by reducing the charges of the European Union, which Marine Le Pen falsely claims to be 9 billion, or immigration.
