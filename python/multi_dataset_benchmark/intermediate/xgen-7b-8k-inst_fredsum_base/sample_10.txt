Jordan Bardella, a candidate for the French presidency, discusses the issue of retirement age with Gerald Darmanin, a candidate who is elected. Bardella argues that the current discussion is focused on the age of full retirement, which is not the only factor in determining retirement age. He suggests that people who start working at 17-20 years old may not be able to retire at 65-70 years old due to the progressive nature of the retirement system.

He also mentions that some people who work in difficult jobs may not be able to retire at full pension, and that Emmanuel Macron's reform aims to balance the budget and ensure that people can live comfortably in old age.
