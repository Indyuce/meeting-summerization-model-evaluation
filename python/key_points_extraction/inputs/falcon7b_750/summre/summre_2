Advertising will be carried out by [214] and [215] on social networks, as well as with expensive biodegradable posters to avoid pollution. The following animation workshops are proposed: making dolls in the style of Chucky, daycare and screening of Miraculous, simple Avatar makeup, circus, and lion show related to Narnia, although the latter is not chosen. [215] suggests inviting the famous TikToker Rodrigo to ensure event security, before deciding that security will be managed by the municipal police. [216], as a resident of Avignon, wants to negotiate rates and dates with the city hall, although they are not familiar with the current mayor. [213], who speaks English well, will call production companies to bring in the stars of the screened films. They will come with their own security and makeup teams. [214] will invite food trucks, from which they will collect 5 to 10% of the revenue. The idea of having an organizer handle the food has not been chosen."
