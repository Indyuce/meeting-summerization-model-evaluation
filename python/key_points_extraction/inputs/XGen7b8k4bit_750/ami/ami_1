It has to be fancy .\nD: Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,\nC: <gap>\nD: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside\nD: and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing\nD: which we w may think that would have been the most important ,\nD: which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control .\nD: So as you see uh <vocalsound> it first have to be very nice ,\nD: s something that people are proud of\nD: uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with\nD: uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff\nD: that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours .\nD: And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control\nD: but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . <vocalsound>\nC: <vocalsound>",
