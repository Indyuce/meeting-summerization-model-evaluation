That's a good one .\nA: So ,\nA: I'm afraid we have to move on .\nA: And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think .\nA: If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh <disfmarker>\nB: Yeah .\nA: But we will see .\nD: That's true .\nD: Might uh <disfmarker> might be confusing too .\nA: Yeah . That's definitely right .\nD: They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?\nB: Mm-hmm .\nA: Yeah .\nB: But very special ,\nB: so uh <disfmarker>\nA: I would buy it . <vocalsound>\nB: <vocalsound>\nC: <vocalsound>\nD: <vocalsound> Yeah .\nD: But you're not sixty . <vocalsound>\nA: That's right .\nA: I would buy it if I was six . <vocalsound>\nA: No I don't know .\nA: What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ?\nA: No ?\nA: Uh , yes they are .\nC: <vocalsound>",

Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ?\nD: And recognability . If our company is <disfmarker> If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?\nD: And <disfmarker>\nD: So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .\nA: Okay .\nD: Let's see .\nD: Oh\nD: I have to say this was a little hard ,\nD: because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .\nA: Yeah ,\nA: that's because my pen failed to upload his data .\nB: Mm .\nD: Okay .\nB: Yeah ? <vocalsound>\nA: <vocalsound> I tried to\nD: Interesting .\nA: but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .\nD: So <disfmarker> <vocalsound>\nB: Mm .
