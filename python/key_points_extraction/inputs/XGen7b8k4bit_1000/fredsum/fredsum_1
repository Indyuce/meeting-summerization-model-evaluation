Jordan Bardella explique que les deux ans de travails en plus annulent le congé parental. Olivier Véran répond qu'il mettra en place la comptabilisation du congé proche aidant, pour aider ses proches malades, que Mathilde Panot ne souhaite pas voter dans le contexte de la loi. Jordan Bardella rappelle qu'Emmanuel Macron a dit qu'il était déjà difficile d'arriver à 62 ans quand on avait une carrière industrielle. Jordan Bardella explique que les gens seront contraint de partir avant 64 ans et de subir une décôte. Le présentateur explique qu'Emmanuel Macron ne voulait pas réformer la retraite avant d'avoir réglé le problème du chômage. Jordan Bardella explique que les jobs créés par Emmanuel Macron sont des jobs à faible productivité qui n'apporte pas de côtisations. Jordan Bardella explique que pour résoudre le problème des retraites, il faut travailler sur la natalité et la productivité, et donc des emplois à forte valeur ajoutée. Olivier Véran explique que beaucoup d'emplois ont été créés les quatres années précédents, sur les déclarations d'Emmanuel Macron, il explique qu'il y a de nombreux emplois à pourvoir en france. Mathilde Panot explique que la réforme va créer une hausse du RSA et du chômage. Olivier Véran explique qu'après la réforme de 2010, des leçons ont été apprise pour éviter la hausse du chômage, et que c'est pour ça que la réforme coûtera de l'argent au départ. Olivier Véran explique que l'âge de l'annulation de la décote de change pas, et que le recul de l'âge de départ est progressif.

Olivier Véran accorde qu'il y a du travail à faire sur le travail des seniors. Jordan Bardella rappelle qu'avec une hausse de dix points du taux d'emploi des seniors, le manque à gagner de la caisse des retraites disparaît, et que la réforme encourage les jeunes à rentrer trop tard dans le monde du travail. Jordan Bardella rappelle que son système qui laisse partir à la retraite à 60 ans les français qui ont commencé à travailler entre 17 et 20 ans coûte seulement 9 milliards d'euros par an.

Mathilde Panot explains that with the retirement reform, nurses will have to work until 67 years old. Olivier Véran explains that this won't be the case within a standard career and that parental leave periods will remain in place. Jordan Bardella explains that the additional two years of work cancel out the parental leave. Olivier Véran responds that he will implement the counting of caregiving leave to help those taking care of sick family members, a proposal that Mathilde Panot does not wish to vote for within the context of the law. Jordan Bardella recalls that Emmanuel Macron stated that reaching 62 years old is already challenging for those with industrial careers. Jordan Bardella explains that people will be forced to retire before 64 and endure pension reductions. The presenter explains that Emmanuel Macron didn't want to reform retirement until addressing the unemployment issue. Jordan Bardella explains that the jobs created under Emmanuel Macron are low-productivity jobs that don't contribute significant contributions. Jordan Bardella explains that to solve the pension problem, we need to focus on birth rates and productivity, thus creating high-value-added jobs. Olivier Véran explains that many jobs have been created in the previous four years, as per Emmanuel Macron's statements, and there are numerous job opportunities available in France. Mathilde Panot explains that the reform will lead to an increase in the minimum social benefits (RSA) and unemployment. Olivier Véran explains that lessons have been learned from the 2010 reform to avoid rising unemployment and that's why the reform will initially incur costs. Olivier Véran explains that the age at which pension reduction is canceled remains unchanged, and the increase in retirement age is gradual. Mathilde Panot explains that the work done regarding senior employment with the senior employment index is not sufficiently binding and won't have an effect, as companies have already reached the state-set score. Olivier Véran agrees that there is work to be done regarding senior employment. Jordan Bardella reminds that with a ten-point increase in the senior employment rate, the pension fund's deficit disappears, and the reform encourages young people to enter the workforce too late. Jordan Bardella reiterates that his system, allowing French citizens who started working between 17 and 20 years old to retire at 60, only costs 9 billion euros per year. Jordan Bardella explains that raising the retirement age increases unemployment and pension reductions. Olivier Véran claims that with the other programs, income tax would increase by 50%."

Pour Mathilde Panot, des infirmières devront travailler jusqu'à 67 ans; des cas extrêmement rares d'après Olivier Véran, d'autant plus que le congé parental reste inchangé. Jordan Bardella contextualise, l'augmentation de deux ans de travail annule le bénéfice du congé parental. D'autres avancées sociales sont cependant mise en place d'après Olivier Véran, comme le congé proche aidant; une avancée sociale que Mathilde Panot ne souhaite pas voter si elle est liée à l'augmentation de l'âge de départ à la retraite. Jordan Bardella continue en citant Emmanuel Macron, qui a lui même dit qu'il était déjà difficile d'arriver à la retraite à 62 ans en bonne santé. Pour lui, les gens ne pourront pas suivre l'augmentation de l'âge de départ à la retraite, et devront partir avec une décote. Jordan Bardella rappelle que les jobs qui ont été créés depuis 2017 sont des travails à faible valeur ajoutée, et qu'il faut donc travailler sur la natalité et la productivité, en créant des emplois de qualités qui rapportent des cotisations. Pour Olivier Véran, de nombreux emplois ont été créés, et beaucoup d'autres sont à pourvoirs; une affirmation contestée par Mathilde Panot. Pour elle, l'augmentation de l'âge de départ va augmenter la précarité dans le pays et coûter cher en aides sociales. Olivier Véran assure cependant que de nombreux dispositifs ont été mis en place pour s'assurer que ce ne sera pas le cas; notamment, le mécanisme d'invalidité reste inchangé, l'âge d'annulation de la décôte n'est pas augmenté, et le recul de l'âge de départ est progressif. Mathilde Panot continuant en mettant en cause l'efficacité de l'index senior, qui n'est lié à aucune sanction, et qui n'aura donc aucun effet bénéfique sur l'emploi des personnes âgées. Olivier Véran accorde qu'il y a du travail à faire sur l'emploi des seniors, il rappelle qu'une amende est mise en place pour les entreprises qui ne publient pas leur index, et qu'il est prêt à aller plus loin si il n'y a pas d'obstruction parlementaire, bien qu'il n'explicite pas d'autre pistes. De son côté, Jordan Bardella montre que la réforme des retraites va motiver les jeunes à rentrer dans le monde du travail le plus tard possible; la réforme avantage les personnes qui commencent à travailler plus tard. Il propose une réforme qui permettrait aux personones qui ont commencé à travailler entre 17 et 20 ans de pouvoir partir à la retraite à 60 ans avec 40 annuiés, avec une progressivité qui ne dépassera pas les 42 annuités et les 62 ans. Sur les sanctions pour les entreprises qui licencient les seniors, Mathilde Panot explique être ouverte à voter des lois, mais pas dans le cadre de la réforme des retraites, qui augmenterait le RSA et le chômage. Olivier Véran continue en expliquant que le programme du rassemblement national créera trop de dette, rajoutant un coût au déficit déjà en place, qui reviendrait à augmenter de 50% l'impôt sur le revenu. Jordan Bardella ironise sur ce chiffre, et rappelle que le gouvernement d'Olivier Véran a créé 600 milliards d'euros de dettes, tout en effondrant le système de la santé, de la police et de la justice.",
            "text_en": "In this debate, Jordan Bardella, Mathilde Panot, and Olivier Véran discuss the work of seniors. According to Mathilde Panot, nurses will have to work until the age of 67; extremely rare cases according to Olivier Véran, especially since parental leave remains unchanged. Jordan Bardella provides context, stating that the two-year increase in retirement age cancels out the benefit of parental leave. However, Olivier Véran argues that other social advancements are being implemented, such as caregiver leave; a social advancement that Mathilde Panot does not want to vote for if it's tied to an increase in the retirement age. Jordan Bardella continues by quoting Emmanuel Macron, who himself said that reaching retirement at 62 years in good health was already difficult. For Bardella, people won't be able to keep up with the increase in retirement age and will have to leave with a reduction in benefits. He reminds that the jobs created since 2017 are low value-added jobs, and therefore, efforts should be directed towards birth rates and productivity by creating quality jobs that contribute to contributions. According to Olivier Véran, many jobs have been created, and many more are available; a statement contested by Mathilde Panot. She believes that increasing the retirement age will increase precarity in the country and result in high costs for social assistance. However, Olivier Véran assures that numerous measures have been put in place to ensure this won't be the case; notably, the disability mechanism remains unchanged, the age at which benefits aren't reduced is not increased, and the gradual shift in retirement age. Mathilde Panot continues by questioning the effectiveness of the seniority index, which is not linked to any penalties and therefore will have no beneficial effect on the employment of older individuals. Olivier Véran concedes that there's work to be done regarding senior employment; he emphasizes that fines are imposed on companies that don't disclose their index and he's willing to go further if there's no parliamentary obstruction, although he doesn't specify other options. On the subject of sanctions for companies that lay off seniors, Mathilde Panot explains she's open to voting for laws, but not within the framework of retirement reform, as it would increase welfare costs and unemployment. Olivier Véran continues by explaining that the National Rally's program would create too much debt, adding to the existing deficit, resulting in a 50% increase in income tax. Jordan Bardella jests at this number and points out that Olivier Véran's government has accumulated 600 billion euros in debt, all while causing the collapse of the healthcare, police, and justice systems."

So, are you okay with living in a country where you'll have a nurse giving you injections at 67 years old, where there will be teaching assistants (ATSEM) with children, nurses who have to carry them at 67 years old?\nOV: But which nurse is giving me injections at 67 years old? Tell me the scenario.\nMP: Well, the scenario is about people who don't have complete careers and who can't have the reduction.\nOV: Alright, so it's someone who started as a nurse, Mrs. Pannot, at 24 years old, or is it someone who started at 20 years old and had 4 years of complete work interruption, not related to maternity. Are we agreed? Are we agreed or not? So, I'm asking you, who is it?\nMP: Do you realize that in terms of feminist achievements in our country, for example, for people in the private sector, when you have a child, you get 4 quarters for childbirth and 4 quarters for upbringing. You have 2 years. You're taking that away.\nOV: Oh no, we're not taking anything away, Mrs. Panot. The 8 quarters per child remain.\nMP: You're making it 2 years for 1 child in the private sector.\nOV: I'm sure that out of the 20 articles, if we looked at them together, there are about ten that you could vote for. Considering parental leave, is that good or not?\nMP: 3000 women, is that it? 900,000 women who won't work.\nOV: It's not me who decides who will take parental leave. Is it good or not?\nJB: The issue isn't parental leave, working longer cancels out the benefit you have, but don't force people to work an additional 2 years.\nOV: The caregiver leave, which means someone is taking care of a child or a relative, a sick parent, agreed, in a situation of disability, and as a result, can't work; until now, that wasn't counted, now we're saying it's counted, it's not time wasted, and we won't force you to work later, is that good or not? Will you vote for it? Do you vote for it?\nMP: Well no, not under these conditions.\nOV: You're not voting for it. So, there we won't agree. But now, you'll struggle to explain.\nMP: But if you were to make a law just about caregiver leave, we would vote for it, but here, you're forcing everyone to work 2 more years. You're explaining to us that it's extraordinary. You'll have 4 extra quarters for this, but you're taking 8 away on the other side. But be serious, Mr. Minister.\nOV: But we're not taking 8 quarters away from anyone, actually.\nMP: Of course you are. When you force people to work 2 more years. When you raise the legal age from 62 to 64, it means that people who need a complete career will have to leave.\nOV: Are we taking, yes or no, maternity quarters away from women? Yes or No.\nMP: But if you're putting them on one side to take them back from the other side?\nOV: It's in the draft law.\nMP: But no. In fact, it's the same thing, in fact.\nOV: Well no, excuse me. It's not the same thing.\nMP: Of course it is, it's the same thing. Because you're forcing them to work until 64.\nOV: But Mrs. Panot, I'm asking you. Are we changing how maternity leaves are considered for women?\nMP: Do you understand that I'm trying to explain that you're asking women to work the same amount of time that they get when they have a child?\nP2: Let's give the floor to Jordan Bardella, who's very behind.",

            "text_en": "JB: I think we're getting a bit off track here. Namely, the raising of the legal retirement age. I'll quote someone for whom Mrs. Panot and Mr. Véran voted in the presidential election, Emmanuel Macron. In 2019, Emmanuel Macron said, and I mean, when you're not highly qualified, when you live in a region facing industrial difficulties, when you have a fractured career, good luck getting to 62, that's the reality of our country. So, what do you tell these French people? What did you tell them in Hauts-de-France?\nOV: I tell them that today, there are entire departments where there are more job openings than Category A unemployed.\nMP: No, no, no, it's 400,000 unfilled jobs, while there are 10 million unemployed. Stop, there are sociologists, well-known sociologists who have worked on this issue. Hadrien Clouet, who is a deputy in my group, a sociologist specializing in unemployment.\nOV: Who is an LFI deputy?\nMP: Yes, an LFI deputy. But you'll see. But no, Mr. Véran, no. What does it mean to be an LFI deputy, I turn like this, right?\nOV: Say that he's someone who is an activist in your party, I have a lot of respect.\nMP: But so what? Do you think a sociologist can't be an activist? He did sociological work on this to explain why. The famous argument of unfilled jobs, there are around 400,000, 6 million unemployed, can't you see there's a problem in there? I'll tell you what your reform will create, it will create a factory for welfare, a factory for unemployment, a factory for the poverty trap. Did you see what the president of the French Mutualité Federation said? That your reform would cost 10 billion in disability, in inability to work, that the social cost of raising the retirement age to 64 is over 110,000 people, at least socioeconomically, including RSA, specific solidarity allowance, or adult disability allowance. It's over 400,000 sick leaves or work accidents per year, and over 177,000 additional unemployed, and when you look at the OFCE, over 177,000 up to 400,000 additional unemployed.\nOV: Can I respond?\nMP: Well yes.\nMP: I hear that the head of the mutual society is making predictions about the evolution of unemployment and the macroeconomic impact on our country. He's better at it than I am. I'm not capable of doing it. So I say this without any irony. I believe I understood that these predictions are based on the impact of the 2010 retirement reform, which effectively postponed the retirement age by 2 years. And precisely because we are aware of the impact it might have had in terms of insecurity among seniors and the increase in the number of additional beneficiaries of the RSA, we didn't make the same mistakes as in 2010. I'll give you just 3 elements. The first one, and you'll see why sometimes, and what Mr. Bardella was saying for that matter, is true, is that at the beginning, it's going to cost us a bit of money, but we accept that, this reform. For example, we're not changing anything, we're not changing anything about the disability mechanism, as I mentioned earlier. That's 3 billion euros. It's 3 billion euros compared to what we could have achieved if we compare it with the 2010 reform. And we're fine with that, nothing changes for them, and that's normal. And already, this helps us avoid, if you will, creating poverty traps. Second, we're not changing the age of 67, which is the famous age of canceling the reduction, whereas in 2010, it was shifted by 2 years. It's true that the transition from 65 to 67 was complicated for a number of our fellow citizens. And then, in 2010, there was quite a rapid, if you will, implementation over the two years, whereas now, we have a gradual transition over almost 10 years. It's 3 months per year, which means there's a different capacity for adaptation. And what the studies we commissioned say, which are not government studies once again, is that this way, we're protecting ourselves more from the risks that were observed in 2010 with a reform that was too quick and affected everyone, including disabled individuals.\nMP: Well, I'll respond to that point, because, and you haven't contested this figure, you know that there has been a 157% increase in senior beneficiaries of RSA (Revenu de Solidarité Active, a social assistance program) in 10 years. You know that.\nOV: But you're saying it, the effect of the 2010 reform was real.",

            "text_en": "MP: Exactly, it was catastrophic. What are you going to do about this issue? So, you talk about time, you also have your index. I'm surprised you haven't brought it up yet. So, the index for seniors, and you often refer to what was done with the gender pay gap index, saying that it had an incredible effect, that's false. There's still a 22% difference between men's and women's salaries, and an average of 40% difference in pensions between women and men.\nOV: Well, pensions.\nMP: I'll tell you. Your index.\nOV: Because the normalization of women's salaries hasn't had an impact yet.\nMP: Your index, it's not binding in the sense that 92% of companies are not subject to any sanctions, because they have achieved a score that you've set at 100, 75 out of 100. Well, I'll skip over these details. But what you're doing now, by setting the age at 64, is increasing poverty in this country. You're creating more traps for people who will be neither employed nor unemployed when they reach retirement. And you know that this rate is very high.\nP1: Olivier Véran.\nOV: I haven't given up hope of finding points of agreement with you tonight, Madame Panot. It might surprise you, but I consider that the senior index is one of the topics on which we could perhaps go further. I say this because it needs to be a collaborative effort, etc.\nP1: What does \"going further\" mean?\nOV: It means that the senior index, it means that companies are obliged to publish the number of seniors they employ in the company. Alright? If they don't do it, they face a fine that amounts to 1% of the payroll. This means that if you have 500 employees, you'll have the equivalent of 5 salaries deducted as a fine, so you better publish it. Well, that was the demand of the unions. That was the demand of the unions in the negotiations. And we've included it. Now, I hear and we hear that it's a point on which we could discuss and potentially make changes if it turns out to be necessary. Let me tell you something where I think we can agree. It's that the social plans for early retirement or the general layoff plans in big companies, where it's always the seniors who are let go, I don't like that either. Neither does the Prime Minister, by the way. I can guarantee you that.\nP2: Could you implement more stringent measures?\nOV: We will get to the parliamentary debate later, I imagine. But we have a bill that has already been amended. That wouldn't have escaped anyone. We were talking about 65 years, now it's 64 years. We have a balanced approach for justice and progress. So, we say that the parliamentary debate that will open up should allow us to address this, and that's why I hope there will be a real debate and not parliamentary obstruction.\nMP: But this is nonsense, Mr. Minister. Do you know how many days there are for discussion?\nOV: I'm really trying to find common ground with you.\nP1: We'll get there later, we'll get there later.\nMP: I'm telling you, there will be 3 days of committee discussions. And only 11 days in the Assembly. And we could have had 12 days, an additional day of debate. Except that Macron's party and the National Rally refused to move a day reserved for the Socialist Party. So, we don't have those 12 days of debate.\nP1: Excuse me. Just a clarification, Olivier Véran. Just a clarification, Olivier Véran. Does this mean, for example, that you could impose quotas on companies to hire seniors?\nOV: I can't go further than what I've told you. These are points on which we are open to exchanging ideas, dialoguing with parliamentarians.\nP2: How to prevent these early retirement plans?\nOV: We said we're talking about enriching the legislation. Obviously.\nP2: How to prevent these early retirement plans? What possibilities are there? Are you considering sanctions against these companies?\nOV: I'm just saying that the bill we presented, you know it, and then we're saying, sincerely, that we're open to improvements. If the parliamentarians decide to improve this aspect of the bill, we'll look at it favorably. I can't go further than that.\nP1: Jordan Bardella?

            "text_en": "JB: Yes, maybe we can have a consensus tonight, at least, on this subject. Well, I mean, the employment rate of seniors, many economists have spoken out, they say, if we increase the senior employment rate by 10 points, then at that moment, the issue of the 10 billion euros shortfall in the state coffers disappears completely. But realize that we are here, in the process, tonight, having absolutely chaotic debates that worry a very large majority of the French population. I remind you, 68% of the French people, according to an Ifop survey, are opposed to this pension reform, due to a 10-billion-euro annual shortfall in the pension funding system. I mean, I'm surprised to see the government initiate such maneuvers, especially when the government has just voted for a deficit, a deficit budget of 160 billion, after pouring 600 billion euros of public money into the deficit-ridden French economy. So, if you will, we need to keep our perspective; we talk a lot.\nOV: This is the moment when we can discuss your program.\nJB: Let me finish, I'm getting to my program. We talk a lot about the French economy, we talk a lot about the senior employment rate, but we could also talk about the junior employment rate, because in reality, the government's reform is also where I disagree with you on the retirement age increase. In reality, your reform will encourage people to enter the workforce as late as possible. So, the France that you will penalize, the France that gets up early, is the France of vocational training diplomas, it's the France of professional degrees, it's the France of all those who love these demanding manual professional jobs that are generally practiced with passion, and who actually think, why should I pursue this path, especially when manual jobs are undervalued in the traditional curriculum, why bother, especially when I'll have to work longer, if I enter the job market at 24 or 25 years old, after completing a 5-year degree and spending 2 years wandering in Singapore. So, in reality, our reform and our project, which is a progressive system aiming to allow retirement between 17 and 20 years of work with 60 years of age and 40 years of contributions, costs 9 billion euros per year, but I think it's a societal choice. And beyond that, there is a progression that naturally takes place up to 42 years of contributions and a legal retirement age of 62. It's normal that when you started working at 24, 25 years old, you retire a bit later, but just people who started working early should be able to retire earlier. And our reform, in this case, supports this France of vocational training diplomas, as it encourages them to start at a reasonable age after completing their studies—I was talking about vocational training diplomas to enter the job market. You told me earlier, Mr. Minister, that we are guaranteed that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, this reform will benefit us, even if it's true that this year it will cost us. But you seem to be clairvoyant, because in this case, the High Council for Public Finance says we are unable to predict what will happen tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. And I've heard a number of ministers say that another reform will be needed from 2030 onwards because ours won't go beyond 2030. And I may have rushed a bit earlier, but I remind you, the horn says it, delaying the retirement age could increase the state's social spending for a very simple reason: 42% of the people who are retiring today are unemployed, meaning either unemployed or long-term unemployed, meaning they are out of the traditional unemployment categories, or they are, of course, affected by illness.\nP2: Mathilde Panot, we will give you the floor, you are behind compared to others. Olivier Véran, however, said something important earlier. He said that regarding senior employment, there will be advancements and, in essence, companies that do not hire seniors could be penalized. So, if it goes even further, if it's about penalizing companies that lay off seniors, would you then consider voting in favor?",

            "text_en": "MP: But in a law, it shouldn't force millions of people to work two more years. No, but because, come on, let's revisit the arguments that Mr. Minister, then, Mr. Minister, who admits that the reform slightly penalizes women, you noticed that I still don't have the number of people who will receive 1,200 euros, and you understand that, since it's a full career, women won't get it, that the parental leaves that the government boasts about will only benefit 3,000 women per year, between 2,000 and 3,000 women per year, but 200,000 women will have to work longer, between 62 and 64 years old. Then, Mr. Véran hasn't said it yet, but he will at some point, we have a mandate to carry out this reform. The thing is, right after his election, the re-elected President of the Republic said, I know that not all French people voted for me for my program and their vote obliges me. I know that not all French people voted for me for my program and their vote obliges me. So, he doesn't have the mandate to carry out this reform. Then, he explains to us that there would be an incredible deficit in the pension system.\nJB: Ah, thank you for your response to my earlier question.\nMP: No, you don't know my vote, Mr. Bardella. In the pension system.\nJB: Yes, you voted for Emmanuel Macron, like all your friends from La France Insoumise (Left Party), and today you come here and act as if you're against Macron, Mr. Véran is mean.\nMP: You vote for all the laws. So, then he tells us that this reform is essential, even though the Pension Advisory Council says the exact opposite. Then we're told that.\nP1: Sorry, you're giving us a summary. You're summarizing the show for us.\nMP: Yes, but it's still beautiful to see those who have a project that will make us work two years longer than others, those who hesitated between 65 and 60 years in 2017.\nJB: You didn't hesitate to vote for Macron, did you? You didn't hesitate.\nMP: But you don't know my vote, actually.\nJB: Tell me, you know my vote.\nMP: And I don't vote for Macron's laws, unlike your group in the National Assembly.\nJB: Because you are the hypocrites of the opposition.\nMP: We are not hypocrites, in fact, we are the largest opposition.\nJB: Who did you call to vote for? All the leaders, all the heads of all the parties in La Nupes (a satirical term), called to vote for Emmanuel Macron. That is, for the social executioner of the French people.\nP2: Can we continue the show?\nMP: Even a chair would be elected against Marine Le Pen.\nJB: I hope you will have the opportunity to be",
