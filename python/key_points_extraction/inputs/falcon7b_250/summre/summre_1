Le genre romance est abandonné pour son inadéquation avec l'horreur, bien que [215] y tienne particulièrement. Il s'agit ensuite de conserver deux genres parmi aventure, fantastique et horreur. Horreur et fantastique, défendu par [215], apparaît moins populaire qu'horreur et aventure, soutenu par [213], mais cela permettrait la découverte. [216] tranche pour horreur et fantastique et propose de diffuser des films d'horreur, des films fantastiques et des films qui mélangent ces deux genres. Ensuite, les locuteurs doivent choisir entre un cinéma classique, un drive-in et un cinéma art déco. Ce dernier offrirait un cadre plus intimiste, personnalisable, mais avec moins de place. En revanche, le drive-in serait plus rentable, accessible aussi au piéton, pourvu qu'ils arrivent à se procurer une grande toile. Cette solution est retenue et il est même proposé d'allumer un feu d'artifice en fin de projection. Pour le lieu, il faut d'abord trouver un terrain propice, ce qui n'est pas le cas à Paris, à Montpellier, à Aix ou à Toulouse. C'est Avignon et son gros parc qui est retenu, puisque la ville héberge déjà un festival très attractif, bien que des doutes soient émis sur la faisabilité d'y inviter une star. Ils proposent ensuite 5 films d'horreur: Shining en tant que classique indémodable, Vendredi 13, Birds de Hitchcock, Chucky qui pourrait même plaire aux enfants, Les griffes de la nuit. Ainsi que 5 films fantastiques: Le monde de Narnia et Dragon pour le côté familial, Harry Potter à l'école des sorciers, Le voyage de Chihiro car c'est un classique du studio Ghibli, et le dernier n'est pas déterminé à la fin de l'enregistrement.",
            "text_en": "This meeting gathers 4 speakers to decide on the location and the films to be screened at the festival they are organizing. The romance genre is abandoned due to its mismatch with horror, although [215] is particularly attached to it. The next step is to retain two genres among adventure, fantasy, and horror. Horror and fantasy, advocated by [215], seems less popular than horror and adventure, supported by [213], but this would allow for variety. [216] takes the side of horror and fantasy and suggests screening horror films, fantasy films, and films that blend these two genres. Next, the speakers must choose between a classic cinema, a drive-in, and an Art Deco cinema. The latter would offer a more intimate and customizable setting but with less space. On the other hand, the drive-in would be more profitable, accessible to pedestrians as well, provided they manage to acquire a large screen. This solution is chosen, and there's even a proposal to have a fireworks display at the end of the screening. For the location, they first need to find a suitable area, which is not the case in Paris, Montpellier, Aix, or Toulouse. Avignon and its large park are selected since the city already hosts a highly attractive festival, although doubts are raised about the feasibility of inviting a star there. They then propose 5 horror films: \"The Shining\" as a timeless classic, \"Friday the 13th,\" Hitchcock's \"The Birds,\" \"Chucky,\" which could even appeal to children, and \"A Nightmare on Elm Street.\" As well as 5 fantasy films: \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" and \"Dragon\" for the family aspect, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" \"Spirited Away\" because it's a classic from Studio Ghibli, and the last one is not determined by the end of the recording."
