Nicolas Sarkozy souhaite aussi avoir un examen de français avant l'entrée sur le territoire pour les gens âgés de plus de seize ans, et souhaite conditionner les aides sociales à dix ans sur le territoire, dont cinq ans de cotisations. Le présentateur pose ensuite la question du droit de vote des étrangers aux éléctions municipales. François hollande est pour le droit de vote des étrangers aux municipales, si ils sont en situation régulière et installé depuis plus de cinq ans. François Hollande explique être contre les centre de rétention, qui mettent des enfants dans des conditions très difficiles Nicolas Sarkozy est contre, car il estime que cela créerait un vote communautariste, qui aiderait les revendications identitaires et communautaires.

François Hollande starts by criticizing Nicolas Sarkozy's track record, pointing out that he increased legal immigration to 200 thousand immigrants per year. François Hollande talks about economic immigration, which he wants to limit. He also explains that he supports student immigration and wants asylum seekers' cases to be processed more quickly. François Hollande concludes by explaining that he supports family immigration, under conditions of minimum income, housing, and French language proficiency.\nNicolas Sarkozy challenges François Hollande's numbers, explaining that immigration is at 180 thousand. He argues that there are too many immigrants and not enough jobs, schools, and housing to integrate them. He proposes having a single judge for foreign rights instead of a detention judge and a judicial judge. Nicolas Sarkozy also wants a French language examination before entry to the territory for individuals over sixteen years old, and he suggests conditioning social benefits on ten years in the country, including five years of contributions.\nThe presenter then raises the question of the voting rights of foreigners in municipal elections. François Hollande is in favor of granting voting rights to foreigners in local elections if they are in a regular situation and have been established for more than five years. François Hollande explains that he is against detention centers, as they subject children to very difficult conditions. Nicolas Sarkozy opposes this idea, as he believes it would lead to a communal vote, which would support identity and community-based demands. François Hollande challenges Nicolas Sarkozy's viewpoint, stating that it is incorrect. The two then discuss the number of naturalizations proposed by François Hollande."

In 2007, when you presented yourself to the French voters, you said, \"Out of the 200,000, I would like half of them to be chosen immigration, economic immigration.\" Ultimately, this target couldn't be reached, and economic immigration fell to 30,000 instead of the expected 100,000..

I say we cannot make families wait a year and a half for a response and then have them stay on our territory if the response is positive, or even if it's negative, they still stay because it's very difficult to leave..

By the way, France treats Muslims in France better than Christians are treated in the Orient. And this is a problem that we are facing.\nDavid PUJADAS: Now François Hollande's response.",

We had a debate together, it was at the Théâtre du Rond-Point in 2003. And I still have the text. You said that you were not in favor of banning the veil in schools. That was your right at the time. You have probably changed your mind since then. I was in favor of it. And I had voted for this law to introduce the ban on the veil in schools. It was Jacques Chirac who had decided on it.
