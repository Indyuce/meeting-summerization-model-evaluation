[175] pense à la romance, où l'on suit le développement des sentiments entre les personnages, avec pour enjeu l'aboutissement de la relation. [175] regarde exclusivement ce genre et en particulier les K-drama, qui n'ont pas vocation à être réaliste. Titanic est un des plus connus parmi ceux issus d'Hollywood. [175] cite Extraordinary you comme K-drama. Un acteur du genre serait George Clooney ou Julia Roberts. La tendance est de rendre les scènes intimes de plus-en-plus explicites, ce que dicte Hollywood et qui résiste encore aux K-drama avec des histoires plus intéressantes. Le public est majoritairement féminin, même si le genre peut être tout public. [176] a choisi les films d'action, caractérisés par les combats physiques, à distance ou au corps-à-corps, qui mettent typiquement en scène quelqu'un qui a perdu quelque chose et qui est en quête de vengeance. Ce qui inspire [176], c'est cette quête d'amélioration physique et mentale, qui passe souvent par un mentor avec qui une relation très forte est nouée. Karaté kid est très connu, Jackie Chan et JCVD avec Double impact, Kickboxing. La tendance est à l'exagération dans l'hémoglobine, les impacts, le spectacle, les scènes de sexe. Ce genre plaît surtout aux hommes. [174] présente les films historiques, qui peuvent mêler romance et rivalité, car ils s'appuient souvent sur une trame qui rajoute fiction et attractivité au récit. L'histoire devient dynamique, imagée, avec des possibilités d'identification, facilitant la pédagogie. Il y a des dramas coréens, comme Hwarang, des séries et films français autour de la révolution, beaucoup de biographies etc. Gérard Depardieu est un habitué du genre, mais peu d'acteurs très connus y sont spécialisés car on cherche un physique et une personnalité qui correspondent aux rôles. l'historique s'est adapté à l'évolution des autres genres et se modernise. C'est destiné à tous les publics.",
            "text_en": "Three people are coming together to determine the genre of films to be shown during their cinematic event. [175] is thinking about romance, where the development of feelings between characters is followed, with the culmination of the relationship at stake. [175] exclusively watches this genre, particularly K-dramas, which are not meant to be realistic. Titanic is one of the most well-known among those from Hollywood. [175] mentions \"Extraordinary You\" as a K-drama. An actor of this genre would be George Clooney or Julia Roberts. The trend is to make intimate scenes increasingly explicit, as dictated by Hollywood, which still resists K-dramas with more interesting stories. The audience is predominantly female, even though the genre can be for all ages. [176] has chosen action movies, characterized by physical fights, either long-distance or close combat, typically featuring someone who has lost something and is on a quest for revenge. What inspires [176] is this pursuit of physical and mental improvement, often involving a mentor with whom a very strong relationship is formed. \"The Karate Kid\" is very well-known, along with Jackie Chan and JCVD with \"Double Impact,\" and Kickboxing. The trend is towards exaggeration in bloodshed, impacts, spectacle, and sex scenes. This genre is especially appealing to men. [174] presents historical films, which can blend romance and rivalry, as they often build upon a framework that adds fiction and attractiveness to the narrative. The story becomes dynamic, vivid, with possibilities for identification, facilitating education. There are Korean dramas like \"Hwarang,\" French series and films about the revolution, many biographies, etc. Gérard Depardieu is a regular in this genre, but few very well-known actors specialize in it because a physical appearance and personality that align with the roles are sought after. Historical films have adapted to the evolution of other genres and are modernizing. They are intended for all audiences."

So, Emma, you can begin. Um, yeah, Emma, you can start.\nspk175: Um, so, I'm going to talk about comedies and romances. Um, I have to admit that I'm not quite sure what comedy really is. I've never really understood, you know, romantic comedy because it's not always humorous every time. If comedy means humorous plus, then, um, concerning the romance genre, well, most of the time, it's about two individuals, or three, it depends, or even more, you never know, yeah, there are several. But, um, so, it's, uh, a feeling that develops between these individuals throughout the movie or series, and there's always the suspense of whether they'll end up together or if it's just flirting, you know, that little tension that gives you butterflies in your stomach, we love that. Um, so, well, personally, I admit I almost exclusively watch that. Um, so, yeah, I've been mostly focused on films and series, especially ones from Korea, which are generally very specialized in that. Um, so, yeah, I've seen quite a few, and yet I'm not tired of it, which is quite rare, because I know many people who get tired of the somewhat cheesy stuff, but I, I love it. Um, yeah, so, um, well, it's not necessarily inspiring in real life because things don't really happen that way, clearly.

Um, so, I would say, um, George Clooney, I don't know, I don't know the names of the actors or directors, uh, I don't know how they evolved, but I think the relationship between the characters has become more intense over time. For example, in movies from the 1900s, you don't see much, maybe holding hands or stuff like that. But nowadays, you can see much more, it's more explicit. Um, yeah, so, I wonder how it will change in the future. I think American cinema relies too much on these explicit scenes. I'm not sure if it will come back to how it used to be or if it will develop even more in that direction. I hope not, because then the story loses its meaning, just for scenes that don't necessarily attract more people.
