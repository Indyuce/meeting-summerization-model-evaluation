Valérie Pécresse criticizes Macron's past performance and his lack of substantial reforms. She advocates for reforms in various sectors and pledges to raise the retirement age except for those with demanding careers. Éric Zemmour supports raising the retirement age to sixty-four and proposes cost-saving measures, primarily related to immigration and social fraud. He argues for a systematic approach to cutting jobs and merging certain councils for savings. Pécresse challenges the funding of Zemmour's promises and emphasizes the importance of economic strength through reforms. The debate involves a back-and-forth exchange of views on the need for reforms and responsible fiscal policies."

He supports raising the retirement age to sixty-four, which he believes would save approximately twenty billion euros. Pécresse, on the other hand, pledges to raise the retirement age to sixty-five except for those with long and arduous careers. She also proposes to increase the minimum pension and widow's pension.\nZemmour's program is further challenged for not having enough substantial reforms. Pécresse argues that cost-cutting related to fighting social fraud, implementing economic tax cuts and cutting social benefits for non-European contributors won't be sufficient to cover deficits and implement fundamental changes. Zemmour defends his approach, stating he will assess needs and make systematic cuts, such as merging certain councils to save money.\nPecresse announces two hundred thousand public job cuts. Zemmour says it's unrealistic, and Pecresse highlights her past success in delivering on her promises to reduce public jobs in her region."

Today, an important current event has occurred: one of the twelve qualified candidates, Emmanuel Macron, who is currently leading according to polls, has made a proposal. It's related to the economy. He wants to raise the legal retirement age to sixty-five, which is not the case today. You know this. Valérie Pécresse, you have repeatedly accused President Emmanuel Macron of emptying the treasury. Now, he's filling it up again. If he does that, he'll also replenish the pension funds. So, he's repenting. Do you appreciate this measure as it deserves?",
