I think the <disfmarker>\nF: just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event .\nA: Mm - hmm .\nF: There 's , um <disfmarker> in my mind , anyways , there 's a difference between , um , acoustic features and acoustic events .\nF: And I think of acoustic features as being , um , things that linguists talk about ,\nF: like , um <disfmarker>\nE: So , stuff that 's not based on data .\nF: Stuff that 's not based on data , necessarily .\nE: Yeah .\nE: Oh , OK .\nF: Right .\nE: Yeah .\nE: Yeah ,\nF: That 's not based on , you know , acoustic data .\nE: OK .\nF: So they talk about features for phones ,\nF: like , uh , its height ,\nF: its tenseness ,\nA: Yeah .\nF: laxness ,\nF: things like that ,\nA: Mm - hmm .\nF: which may or may not be all that easy to measure in the acoustic signal .\nF: Versus an acoustic event , which is just <nonvocalsound> some <nonvocalsound> something in the acoustic signal <nonvocalsound> that is fairly easy to measure .\nF: Um . So it 's , um <disfmarker> it 's a little different ,\nF: in <disfmarker> at least in my mind .\nE: I mean , when we did the SPAM work <disfmarker> I mean , there we had <disfmarker> we had this notion of an , uh , auditory <disfmarker> @ @ <comment> auditory event .\nA: Good . That 's great .\nE: And , uh ,\nE: um ,\nE: called them \" avents \" ,\nF: Mm - hmm .\nE: uh , uh , uh , with an A at the front .\nE: Uh .\nE: And the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere .\nE: So .\nA: Mm - hmm .\nE: Um . A sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will <disfmarker> will do sort of this .\nE: I mean , there 's certainly a bunch of <disfmarker> a bunch of places where you know that neurons are gonna fire because something novel has happened .\nE: That was <disfmarker> that was the main thing that we were focusing on there .\nE: But there 's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that aren't just sort of rapid changes ,\nE: but <disfmarker>\nF: It 's kinda like the difference between top - down and bottom - up .\nE: Yeah .\nF: I think of the acoustic <disfmarker> you know , phonetic features as being top - down .\nF: You know , you look at the phone",
