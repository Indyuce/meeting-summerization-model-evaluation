A: Okay everybody is ready ?
A: <vocalsound> Good morning again .
A: So , today we are going to have a f second meeting .
A: Oh Michael , hi .
B: Yep .
A: You're late .
A: You have a good reason for that ?
B: <vocalsound> Yes .
C: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> Very good <vocalsound> .
A: <vocalsound> Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .
A: <vocalsound> So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design .
A: Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to <disfmarker> through the minutes of previous meeting .
A: So uh <vocalsound> basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control ,
A: but I have new um new i inputs for <disfmarker> about that topics .
A: I goin I'm going to share with you .
A: <vocalsound> And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you
A: uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design .
C: Yep .
A: You showed us <disfmarker>
A: you ar you you prepare something for us ?
C: Yeah . Yep .
A: The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah ,
A: and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .
B: Mm .
A: Alright <vocalsound> so <vocalsound>
A: so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .
A: But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of <disfmarker> to give a name to the project .
A: So , I just put d quickly Remo ,
A: but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should <disfmarker> we could discuss quickly .
A: Any ideas ?
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Uh the Powerstick .
A: <vocalsound> Powerstick , yeah .
B: <vocalsound>
A: What else ?
A: What else ?
D: Uh . <vocalsound>
B: Maybe a Spanish name would work well .
D: Mm I was thinking of the <disfmarker>
B: Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there .
B: Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish .
D: Mando .
B: Mando .
B: What is that ?
A: Mango ? Mango ?
D: Mando .
A: Mando .
A: M_A_ ?
A: M_A_ ?
D: A_N_ yeah D_O .
A: M_ D_O_ .
A: Mm , okay .
D: It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me ,
A: What does it mean ?
D: but maybe for a Spanish <disfmarker> for I <disfmarker> for <disfmarker>
A: Oh .
B: What does it mean in Spanish ?
D: Control .
B: Control .
A: Hmm . Nice .
B: Okay .
B: 'Cause it also <disfmarker> like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know
B: because you know men like to have control of the remote
D: But <disfmarker>
D: mm , yeah .
B: so it might <disfmarker>
D: Mando sounds Latino . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: The Mando .
A: Okay .
A: <vocalsound> So , let's go for Mando ?
A: Yeah ? No objection ?
C: Yeah , yeah .
B: Yeah that's <gap> .
A: Great .
B: And we could have some like you d
A: So <disfmarker>
B: you could have the fonts you know special ,
B: so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like <disfmarker>
A: Okay , I think this is <disfmarker>
B: Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though ,
A: Okay .
B: do you ?
B: So <disfmarker>
C: Yeah
C: they are the most T_V_ watcher .
C: So we should be careful .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay , I think this is more a question of of <disfmarker>
D: But <disfmarker>
D: yeah
B: Marketing .
D: it uh <disfmarker>
A: I I think this is more a question of of look and feel .
A: Something that should be addressed later
A: We should we should go to other <disfmarker> for the other topics .
D: Yeah because if the product will be international <disfmarker>
B: Well that's the thing .
B: We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a <disfmarker>
A: Yeah okay ,
A: so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name
B: Um .
A: and we'll see for the for the look and feel later .
A: So let's go for the three presentations right now .
A: So , who want to start ?
B: <vocalsound>
D: Maybe maybe I should uh start .
A: So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: Mm . Okay .
A: Okay so I have your slides somewhere ?
D: Yeah .
D: Should be in participant four .
A: Participant four .
A: <vocalsound> This one ?
D: Yeah , yeah .
D: <vocalsound>
D: Uh .
A: S that's coming .
A: Uh <gap>
B: Yeah .
C: Yep .
A: okay . Great .
D: Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements .
D: I prepare a marketing report
D: and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
D: And also I di I did a study with <disfmarker> for the incorporation of new technologies
D: it seems that the remote controls have been <disfmarker> have remained the same for the last five , ten years .
D: There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and <disfmarker>
A: Okay .
D: Yeah . Yeah .
A: Sh next slide ?
A: Okay .
D: Well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> more <disfmarker> most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .
D: So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control ,
D: which is which is good and it's interesting point .
D: Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease ,
D: which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a <disfmarker> with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old .
D: So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control .
D: They are also <vocalsound> <disfmarker>
D: they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often ,
D: so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to <disfmarker>
D: any beep any alarm or something incorporated to <disfmarker> with the remote control every time it it get lost .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: And also I found that young people <disfmarker>
D: the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
A: Okay .
D: So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> in my opinion the Mando <disfmarker> this Mando shouldn't be very small
D: because the smaller it is , the more like <disfmarker> the the liklier it is to get lost .
D: Liklier or more likely ?
B: More likely . <gap>
D: <gap> likely . Okay .
D: Uh <vocalsound> people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use
D: like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often
D: but <vocalsound> they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control .
D: Also the z the design should fit the hand shape .
D: So it may be interesting to to think in a <disfmarker> in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .
B: Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .
B: So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe
D: <vocalsound> Yeah .
B: cut out some <disfmarker> a lot of your market .
D: I dunno
D: I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some <disfmarker> a a small fraction of of this remote controls .
C: Well maybe it could be a universal design .
D: Sorry ?
C: A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .
D: Yeah .
B: Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?
C: Yeah ?
C: That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand ,
D: Yeah .
C: but but <vocalsound> don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?
D: Sorry ?
C: The first and the third point , they are clashing .
B: Well it can still be a <gap> , you can still extend past the hand .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
C: Okay .
D: Like uh <disfmarker>
B: Uh .
C: So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .
B: Well it means <disfmarker> like , this remote here is kind of <disfmarker> is very thin and long so instead of having <disfmarker> you know you might have it kind of <disfmarker> a bit bigger
C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D: Yeah , like <disfmarker>
B: or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something .
C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
A: <vocalsound>
C: So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?
B: <gap>
C: Little sleek , longer ?
B: <gap>
D: No no
C: And it should fit the hand .
D: I was thinking of so like something <disfmarker>
A: Something with the shape of the palm ?
D: yeah .
C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
B: Some finger grips maybe .
D: Yeah .
B: You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything ,
A: On the sides .
D: Yeah yeah .
D: It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical .
B: but <disfmarker>
C: Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D: Not anymore .
D: That's what <disfmarker>
D: yeah .
A: And then finally <disfmarker>
D: And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting ,
D: but I don't know if the budget would be large enough .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff
D: But most of <disfmarker> yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .
A: because uh because <disfmarker>
A: Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh <vocalsound> to bring you to some new uh new informations .
A: We had the new requirements from the <disfmarker> so uh from the head offices of the company ,
A: and so they wanted <disfmarker> so they want to um <disfmarker> they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay , I dunno if you had this information already .
B: No .
A: No ,
A: so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations .
A: Um they want also uh <disfmarker>
D: Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls .
A: Excellent .
A: So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now
A: and uh finally , <vocalsound> it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .
B: <vocalsound> I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point
A: So <disfmarker>
B: because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price
B: if if we're <disfmarker>
B: maybe I can get to this in my presentation though ,
B: but um yeah .
A: Yeah yeah . Sure sure .
A: So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now .
B: Yep . Okay .
A: Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that <disfmarker> this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco
B: Yeah .
B: I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult
B: because if you think <disfmarker> if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound>
A: Sorry ,
A: what is your <gap> ?
B: Uh participant three .
B: You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .
D: Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate ,
D: so <disfmarker> yeah yeah .
B: <vocalsound> Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ <vocalsound> sound turns off . <gap>
D: <vocalsound> Yeah
D: uh channel fifty .
D: Yeah .
C: No
C: it could be command control kind of thing .
C: It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
C: Means you say <disfmarker>
C: you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .
B: Yeah .
C: Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also .
B: Yeah .
C: So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .
B: Mm .
B: Yeah .
C: It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .
B: <vocalsound>
C: Otherwise it's just lying idle .
A: Okay Michael .
B: Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe <gap>
B: be easier to <disfmarker>
A: Sorry ?
B: could I use the mouse , or <disfmarker>
A: Um yeah .
B: Mm . Thanks .
B: Okay .
A: The wheel doesn't work .
B: <vocalsound> Great <vocalsound> .
C: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
B: Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote ,
B: and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes ,
B: and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site .
B: So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days
B: and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant ,
B: but it's not really <disfmarker>
B: it's by no means uh mm you know <vocalsound> on it's own in being so expensive .
B: There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there .
A: <gap> Looks like a P_D_A_ <gap> ?
B: So <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
B: yeah it doe
B: it's <disfmarker>
B: well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen
B: except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons .
B: Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market ,
B: I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens
B: which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions <disfmarker> d different functions on the screen at different times .
B: But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it ,
B: which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel ,
B: which I think is <disfmarker> it's a really kind of important design aspect
B: um is <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker>
B: 'Cause the thing is what a <vocalsound> what we <disfmarker> the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do .
B: And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel .
C: Change the channels .
C: Yeah .
B: Now um
B: uh the <disfmarker>
B: I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel .
B: 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad .
C: Mmm-hmm mm-hmm .
B: I usually use the up and down
C: Yeah yeah .
B: because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers ,
B: so that's just uh <disfmarker> it's annoying .
B: So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy .
B: Now um
B: the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen ,
B: and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: One possibility , if we <disfmarker>
B: now we need to still talk about the price point
B: because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro ,
B: but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen
B: so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on ,
B: you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on .
B: If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel .
B: So if you think about <disfmarker> it's kind of like a <disfmarker> you know in mobile phones now you don't use <disfmarker> you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .
A: <vocalsound>
B: So this would be pretty <disfmarker> kind of a handy thing to have ,
B: but um we we really need t to discuss the price .
B: So , I mean there are <vocalsound>
B: there are uh cheaper <disfmarker>
B: this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple ,
B: there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context .
B: So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons ,
B: because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions .
B: It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible
B: um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control .
B: And <gap> was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks ,
B: but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .
B: So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want .
C: But there is one problem <gap> then the user has to understand each of that functionality .
B: So <disfmarker>
A: Mm-hmm .
B: Yeah well we w
C: Because the same button is doing too many things .
B: Yeah
B: well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control .
B: Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um
C: Mm-hmm .
B: <vocalsound> I I would <disfmarker>
B: if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: They don't really do anything .
B: Maybe you know I <disfmarker>
B: although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever ,
B: but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Um <vocalsound> but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device .
B: Um <disfmarker>
D: H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard
D: because w if people see a remo see the <disfmarker> see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to <disfmarker> very different build <disfmarker> very different to the traditional <disfmarker>
C: It does sampling out of the <gap> .
A: <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound> Well I guess that depends on how you market it .
B: If you <vocalsound>
B: if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .
D: If y
A: Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?
B: So , but <disfmarker>
D: <gap>
B: yep .
B: Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this <disfmarker> a programme driven interface rather than the channel number .
B: So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh <disfmarker> something that would be worth implementing .
B: Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen ,
B: um which maybe maybe is too expensive ,
B: um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here ,
B: the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .
B: I think even that ,
A: <vocalsound>
B: I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement ,
A: Mm-hmm .
B: um but I think that would be quite useful as well .
B: And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television ,
B: but I think one <disfmarker> maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of <disfmarker> you can have with technology ,
B: and maybe we wanna make it something that's <vocalsound> extensible to do other tasks .
B: Say you have like um <vocalsound> a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room .
B: You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development ,
B: but , you know , later on you could you can you know you <disfmarker>
B: also , selling the potential of the device .
B: Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on ,
B: and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as <disfmarker> at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .
A: Okay . <vocalsound>
A: Okay .
A: Okay , thanks .
A: <vocalsound> <gap> you want to go ?
C: Yep .
C: So <disfmarker> yeah .
B: <gap>
A: <gap>
C: So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh ,
C: that means on my own I <disfmarker>
A: This one ?
C: yeah , it should be .
A: Great .
A: No , not that one .
A: <gap> you are two .
C: Two .
A: Alright . <vocalsound>
C: Okay so the working design is uh
C: user i interface could be of two types ,
C: one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing <disfmarker> doing some he is knowing about that technology .
C: So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this ,
C: and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being <disfmarker> sitting on the on the remote .
C: So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them ,
C: and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .
A: Okay ,
A: sorry to interrupt you ,
A: but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .
C: That's right .
C: So anyway , that didn't come into my mind ,
A: Okay .
C: so th that is a possibility .
C: These could be other kind of interfaces .
C: Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces .
A: <vocalsound>
C: So spe buttons are something which is very <disfmarker> everybody is familiar with .
C: So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is ,
A: Mm-hmm .
C: and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking .
C: Otherwise we are just like others in the market .
C: So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type ,
C: and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually .
C: So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons .
C: Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required .
C: And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .
A: Yeah .
A: That increases the the cost also .
C: Uh that's right .
C: But uh means we have to see how much <disfmarker> what kind of microphones and stuff like that .
A: Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well <disfmarker> of such technologies is enough ?
C: Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .
A: Okay .
C: Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc
A: Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones
B: Hmm .
C: That's right .
A: because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control .
C: No it it could be little d yeah it could be <disfmarker>
A: So it could be s a few centimetres .
B: <vocalsound> Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though ,
C: That's right . That's right .
B: because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries .
A: Yeah .
B: So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for <disfmarker>
C: Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
C: Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing
C: so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest .
C: So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself ,
C: and <vocalsound> it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is ,
C: instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay .
A: Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide .
C: Yeah , that's right .
C: Yeah .
C: So we can
A: This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion .
C: That's right . Yep .
A: Okay , next .
C: Yep .
A: Uh that finished ?
C: No no .
C: Components .
A: No ?
A: Components ?
C: Yeah .
C: So , will you go to the next slide ?
A: <vocalsound> Yes sure .
B: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so .
C: We are having a power button and the switch <vocalsound> , which is not much ,
B: <vocalsound>
C: and then we are having the <gap> which is to indicate whether the power is on or not .
C: And then there are two kind of things which can be <disfmarker>
C: so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time <vocalsound> .
B: <vocalsound>
C: So we could not put that .
C: So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there .
C: So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there ,
C: and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller ,
C: and then there could be buttons ,
C: and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format .
C: And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one ,
C: and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .
A: Okay .
C: So this is the easiest design the there could be .
C: So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in <gap> .
C: To have different technologies .
C: So this was the <disfmarker>
C: my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .
B: You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know <vocalsound> turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button
C: Yeah .
A: <vocalsound>
B: like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
C: Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .
A: <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay .
B: Yeah .
C: So these are the slight problems .
A: So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?
C: Because <disfmarker>
C: yeah
C: the reason is that if we go into the market means <disfmarker>
C: though I don't have much idea ,
C: but as he <disfmarker> the uh Marketing Expert presentation was <disfmarker>
D: I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo <vocalsound> everyone will s will buy it .
B: <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Actually I'm not so sure
C: <vocalsound> So if we go with just the <disfmarker>
D: I'm sure .
B: because I'm the <disfmarker>
B: you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm <disfmarker> instead of pressing up on on a remote control .
B: You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said ,
A: Yeah .
B: so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .
A: <vocalsound>
A: Okay so <disfmarker>
D: Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
B: Well it depends if it's a remote control th
D: it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .
B: Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion .
D: <vocalsound>
B: If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be <gap> .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: <vocalsound> Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now .
C: Alright .
A: Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said .
A: We are targeting T_V_ . <vocalsound>
A: We need <vocalsound>
A: we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy ,
A: which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big .
A: Um we have <disfmarker>
D: With a good shape for the <disfmarker>
A: or good shape , yes .
A: We should bring new technologies for young peoples ,
A: and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet .
A: Maybe this is something we can stick to it .
A: And um <vocalsound> also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the <disfmarker> one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate .
A: So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_
A: <vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .
A: Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ .
A: Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ <disfmarker> in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback <disfmarker> to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .
B: Well it depends though <disfmarker> well it depends .
B: If we we don't <disfmarker>
B: unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that .
B: Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there ,
B: but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of <disfmarker> something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus .
B: So that's an extra
A: <vocalsound> Yeah that's right .
A: Don don't you ha
B: cost .
A: don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or <gap> well systems that exist that we can use ?
B: Well this is this is another que
B: we still haven't really defined the remote .
B: Are we still <disfmarker>
B: you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ?
A: Yeah .
B: 'Cause that really makes a big difference .
B: 'Cause <vocalsound> even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s .
B: It's just there are too many T_V_s out there .
A: Yeah . That's good point .
B: It's it's not really gonna <disfmarker>
A: What's what cou what could be the cost of uh <disfmarker>
A: well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?
B: For twenty five Euro ? <vocalsound> I think it's impossible .
A: Yeah .
C: It's not possible . It's impossible .
B: But but I dunno ,
D: Yeah .
B: I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that <disfmarker> any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro
B: because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control ,
B: and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics .
B: So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh
D: Uh <disfmarker>
B: of increasing the unit price .
D: What would be <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound> So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is <disfmarker> which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um <disfmarker> in terms to had <disfmarker> to have really an added value ?
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah
B: because <disfmarker>
A: Okay ,
B: yeah .
A: so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is <disfmarker>
D: Wha but what would be <disfmarker>
D: one question ,
D: what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?
B: Well th
D: What what kind of information ?
B: 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .
D: Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the
A: They have tele teletext .
A: Well , because they have teletext on it .
D: the n
A: Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel .
D: Yeah
D: but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays .
A: They have t most of them have teletext ,
D: Yeah .
A: but we want to get rid <disfmarker> well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet .
A: So to to uh
B: You can get a lot more information on it .
A: to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control .
D: So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?
B: So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .
A: The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes
A: you could have uh <disfmarker> o
B: You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something
D: Okay .
B: so you can quickly just kind of <disfmarker> even without reading <disfmarker>
A: Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also .
B: Well no ,
B: but there are the electronic programme guides out there .
C: Are <disfmarker>
B: They may not have pictures , but maybe they do .
B: There's <disfmarker> dependi it also depends on the country .
A: Well because <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: for the same reason that we cannot uh <gap> informations on the T_V_ <gap> . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there .
B: No
B: but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from .
B: So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh .
A: So <disfmarker>
A: so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to <disfmarker>
D: But <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
B: Well I I think if we're gonna <disfmarker> I think we would definitely need the internet connection
B: because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ .
A: <vocalsound>
B: I dunno .
B: We need to find that out .
A: Okay .
A: <vocalsound> We need to close the meeting .
A: Um <vocalsound> so <disfmarker>
C: But <vocalsound> just a small thing ,
C: what kind of market we are targeting ?
A: Very quickly .
C: Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ?
C: So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or <disfmarker>
C: because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself .
C: That is very important .
A: No .
B: Mm .
B: If it's a really small T_V_ maybe <vocalsound> .
A: Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their <gap> ,
C: <vocalsound>
C: Broke . Okay . Okay .
A: and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have .
C: Okay . Okay .
C: Okay . Okay .
A: So this is <disfmarker> that we z that that we should target .
A: So the com the um <vocalsound> the uh <vocalsound>
A: the committment is the following ,
A: we don't go for speech recognition technology .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion .
A: It is up to you to go through this um <vocalsound> uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting .
A: So
D: I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the <disfmarker> than the L_C_D_ .
C: It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ .
A: Yeah , but not sure .
A: Maybe it's cheaper ,
A: but we have no <disfmarker>
D: Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements .
D: You need a internet connection .
D: You need m more things .
B: <vocalsound>
D: But
D: for the speech recognition you you don't need anything .
B: Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop
D: You just say channel fifty , and that's it .
B: I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a <disfmarker> you know .
D: But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars ,
C: Means th yeah twenty five Euros is <disfmarker> yeah , that's right .
B: Well this is what we need to find out .
D: it's <disfmarker>
B: Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?
B: 'Cause otherwise we need <disfmarker>
A: Okay this is <gap> <disfmarker>
A: this is an open question for you .
A: Yeah .
A: This is uh up to you to tell us .
A: But I'm definitely not keen on to to <disfmarker>
D: To move to another target ?
A: no no no ,
A: I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .
A: I'm not confident enough .
A: I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work .
A: I uh that work <disfmarker>
B: It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna <disfmarker>
A: It's real
A: yeah .
A: How to guarantee such performances is really hard .
B: <gap>
D: <gap> the expert uh said ninety five percent <vocalsound> .
C: <vocalsound>
B: Ninety five percent is not good enough though .
A: Well this is still <disfmarker> is is very bad .
B: <gap>
A: So , this is the end of this discussion .
A: Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on .
A: Um <vocalsound> so you have to work on the component uh concept .
C: Okay .
A: Uh you have to work on user interface ,
A: and you have to go through a trend watching .
A: Okay .
A: So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .
A: Um uh we <disfmarker>
A: I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction .
A: Thanks .
B: Yep .
A: Bye .
