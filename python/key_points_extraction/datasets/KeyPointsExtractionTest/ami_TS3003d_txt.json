A: So <disfmarker>
A: Hello . <vocalsound>
D: Good afternoon .
D: Sorry I'm a little late .
A: No problem .
D: Got stuck in the traffic .
C: <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
A: Okay . <vocalsound>
A: That's possible on uh this time of day .
A: Starts at three o'clock . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
D: Yeah .
A: Uh , let me see .
A: Our fourth and last meeting .
A: There he is .
A: Yes .
A: Okay
A: this our last meeting .
A: In this meeting we will discuss our final design .
A: And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project .
A: And then we're going to close the project today as well .
A: So
A: after this you will be uh free to go
A: and uh spend all your money . <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
A: And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design ,
A: and we will do the product evaluation .
A: Um , in order to do that we have this agenda .
A: We'll have the prototype presentation first .
A: Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria .
A: <vocalsound> Then we will look at the finance .
A: Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget .
A: Because everything costs money ,
A: and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost .
A: So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote .
A: But we will see that later .
A: Then we will do the project uh evaluation ,
C: <vocalsound>
A: and the closing after that .
A: We've got forty minutes .
A: So we will be finished at half past three .
A: But first um we will do the <disfmarker> this is prototype presentation .
A: So ,
A: if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .
C: Okay .
C: Well
C: this is what me and Richard came up with .
C: The default spot for the on-off button .
C: The mute button just below that .
C: Then there's the volume and channel selectors .
C: Simple plus-minus button .
C: Uh we thought of a help button .
C: If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen .
C: Then there's the zero to <disfmarker> one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .
C: So it's rather simple prototype .
C: And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .
A: Okay .
D: Um , <vocalsound> is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
B: So <disfmarker>
C: Sure
B: Yeah . Yeah .
C: uh just pop in at any time .
D: Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
B: Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh <disfmarker>
B: So um <disfmarker>
B: You put it uh <disfmarker>
B: you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons .
D: Mm-hmm .
B: And you <disfmarker>
B: But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So <disfmarker>
D: Okay .
D: Okay . Um <disfmarker> Yeah .
A: Okay . Uh but um
A: I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons .
B: Oh yeah ?
A: But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
A: So I'm wondering if we if we neely <disfmarker> really need all of those buttons .
B: <vocalsound>
C: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this .
B: <vocalsound>
A: That's right .
C: And well
B: Yeah .
C: the on-off button , it's it's a necessity .
C: You can't drop that one .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
C: The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .
A: Yeah .
C: The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice .
C: So we could cancel that one .
C: I think the help button really is necessary
B: Yeah yeah .
C: because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
A: Mm .
B: Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh <disfmarker>
A: Long time .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: If you put <disfmarker>
B: But m
B: Yeah .
B: We disc discuss that already .
B: But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option .
B: So uh they just put in uh put <vocalsound> press uh the button and uh <disfmarker>
A: Yeah . Okay .
C: Well , <vocalsound>
C: you can't leave out the number buttons I guess .
B: And uh <disfmarker>
A: Yeah .
C: And <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary .
C: Yeah .
B: Oh .
D: Yeah .
A: Okay .
C: So it's rather basic already .
D: Yeah . Think so .
D: That's what I pointed out earlier .
D: If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .
B: Yeah .
A: Yep .
A: Okay . So
A: we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?
C: Yeah ,
C: they're <disfmarker>
C: It's rather hard to draw on the white-board .
B: Yeah . Yeah ,
A: Just n normal plain buttons .
B: it <disfmarker>
C: But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff .
B: Yeah yeah .
A: Yeah . 'Kay .
B: Just to recognise it ,
B: so uh <disfmarker>
C: Just for recognition .
B: Uh yeah
B: and now we don't need uh LEDs
B: or um <disfmarker> Y uh
A: No .
B: s some uh remote controls uh do it also ,
A: No .
B: but um uh because we use the little display
B: we don't uh have to use it .
B: Uh so <disfmarker>
A: Yeah . Okay .
C: So
C: and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case .
B: Nay .
A: Yep .
C: So they jump out .
A: Okay .
C: And uh that's about it .
A: That's nice .
A: Then because we only have thirty minutes left ,
A: I will move on to the finance part ,
A: which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do .
A: And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
D: <vocalsound>
B: Mm .
A: If we see <disfmarker>
A: I don't know if I've filled in correctly ,
A: so just correct me if you see uh something wrong .
A: I counted two batteries .
A: But maybe we can also use one .
A: I don't know if it's possible .
D: Since it rechargeable .
A: It's rechargeable . That's right .
B: Yeah we can
B: u just uh <gap> <disfmarker>
A: Okay .
A: That's two Euros off . <vocalsound>
B: 'Kay . <vocalsound>
A: We need the advanced chip .
A: So there's not much to uh <vocalsound> to save there .
C: Yep .
A: <vocalsound> Here we have the single curves .
A: Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,
B: Mm .
A: I don't know ,
A: but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control .
B: Yeah .
C: Yes .
A: I think we have to keep that .
B: Yeah .
A: Then we have the case material supplements .
A: It's plastic .
A: It's the cheapest one we need .
A: So that's uh not much to save either .
A: But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
A: So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low .
B: Okay .
B: Yeah .
A: Because you have to <disfmarker> we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,
A: so if we <disfmarker>
A: Let's fir first count the buttons we have now .
B: Uh <disfmarker> Sixteen , I believe so .
A: Because I <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Sixteen .
A: Nah ,
A: that will be even more then .
A: Eighteen Euros .
A: So ,
B: Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button .
A: seventeen .
D: Um <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound>
A: Okay , including the help ?
C: Yep .
D: Damn .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah . Uh seventeen .
D: <vocalsound>
A: I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long .
B: <gap> .
C: Yep .
A: That saves us uh one Euro already .
A: 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?
C: Yeah .
D: Wouldn't <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
A: Fifteen buttons .
D: No . That wouldn't be an option .
A: And this is <disfmarker>
D: Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each ,
D: right ?
A: No those are one , I think .
B: Yeah .
D: Well ,
D: think actually there're two buttons ,
B: Where did uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
B: Uh , it's just one button .
D: aren't they ?
B: But , um <disfmarker> Yeah .
B: There were uh two uh for one big button .
B: But they are uh more expensive than the small ones .
B: Uh , yeah . So <disfmarker>
A: Yeah
A: but th it's not stated in this files .
B: It's just a <gap> .
A: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
D: Well
D: I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
A: That's possibility as well .
D: That would cut the cost .
A: So <disfmarker>
A: And it's good for the design as well .
A: So you can make <disfmarker>
A: Uh let's see .
A: If you make this <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound> Looks a bit like uh a cross . <vocalsound>
A: Plus . Min .
B: But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper .
A: Uh s yeah
A: channel .
B: So uh ,
A: Yeah
B: we've still got four buttons ,
A: w
B: but just um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker>
A: Yeah
A: th I think they count uh the materials .
B: You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um <disfmarker>
A: Yeah
A: on the chip there .
B: Yeah .
B: On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: That's right . That's right .
B: So <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
A: But I think because we have the advanced chip
B: Yeah ,
D: <vocalsound> But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .
B: but <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound> we can just count this as one button .
A: But <disfmarker>
A: No
A: but I think <disfmarker>
C: Yes .
A: <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe it is ,
A: but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros .
A: Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use .
D: Yes .
C: Uh that's that's a big cost .
A: I think they uh try t
C: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
A: That's right ,
A: but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? <vocalsound>
D: Only the docking station , I guess .
A: Yeah .
C: Which isn't the <disfmarker> the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .
A: No .
C: So
C: it's not even taken into the price .
A: That's extra . <vocalsound> That's extra .
A: That's right .
D: Maybe we should to a different supplier .
A: <vocalsound> That's an option .
D: <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah .
A: Poland . Something . <vocalsound> Polish supplier .
A: Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three ,
A: then we save a lot of money as well .
C: <vocalsound> We we could save money on it .
C: But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
B: <gap> .
D: Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . <vocalsound>
C: My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .
C: So <disfmarker>
A: Yeah . That's a point .
B: <vocalsound>
D: Um <disfmarker>
B: Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ?
B: So um <disfmarker> Yeah .
B: We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty
B: or <disfmarker> Can't uh go um <disfmarker>
A: Yep .
C: Yeah .
A: No .
D: Well ,
D: since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy ,
D: maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little .
D: Especially since we have those nice features .
B: Nay .
A: Yeah
A: but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros .
A: We don't have any more budget to develop it .
C: The margin will get too small . Yeah .
B: Is it impossible to <disfmarker>
A: Yeah . So <disfmarker>
B: But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .
B: I don't think so .
A: It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say <disfmarker> Or you can take the single chip .
D: It would be a be a pretty rigid one .
B: S
B: Yeah . <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
C: Ten .
B: But , you can't use uh <disfmarker>
A: There it is . <vocalsound>
B: Yeah .
C: <vocalsound>
A: But then w
A: Good looking .
B: Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh attractive uh o options .
A: Yeah .
B: So uh ,
B: you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty .
B: So <disfmarker>
A: I think it's uh difficult as well ,
D: Or b
A: but <disfmarker>
D: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
C: No remote . <vocalsound>
A: Or we can leave out the ten buttons
A: and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
B: Scroll-wheel's one .
C: <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker>
A: Then w
A: Because then we save ten buttons .
B: No ,
B: it <disfmarker>
A: Then we have five and one .
B: Yeah .
A: And and see .
A: If we have this one and we've got the advanced <disfmarker>
A: W uh , we're getting close . <vocalsound>
C: We're getting closer .
B: Yeah . <vocalsound>
D: But how does scroll-wheel work here ?
A: Then you will <disfmarker> Or maybe you can um scroll .
A: If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display .
A: Until you've got the right number , then you push it .
C: Yeah .
D: That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button .
A: Alright .
A: It's gotta scroll and push .
B: Mm .
A: Okay
A: but then you you can push uh some other button as well .
D: But <disfmarker> Yeah .
C: You could just not scroll for a half a second .
A: Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
C: So you won't need a button .
D: I think that would be like the end of our usability .
A: <vocalsound> But it would definitely crop cost , a lot .
B: D
C: <vocalsound>
B: yeah . <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
D: Yeah ,
D: but <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: And we need the battery .
A: <vocalsound> And the regular chip is not possible ?
A: It has to be advanced ?
C: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .
A: It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay .
B: Hmm .
A: And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
A: That's an option we can <disfmarker>
C: Yep .
B: Ja ja .
A: Then we're almost there .
C: Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .
A: Yeah .
A: So
A: if we <disfmarker>
B: Yeah ,
B: or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .
C: Yeah .
A: Yeah
A: but I think that's <disfmarker> That is a big advantage ,
B: So <disfmarker> Yeah <disfmarker>
A: if we're <disfmarker>
B: Yeah it's a big advantage .
B: But um , it's <disfmarker>
A: But <disfmarker>
A: Can we use <disfmarker>
A: can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
C: I think so . Yeah .
B: Uh , yeah .
D: Well ,
A: If you push it three times ?
D: think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are
B: Yeah .
D: right now you just push the teletext button ,
D: go to page eight eight eight ,
A: Yeah .
D: and teletext disappears .
B: Yeah .
D: But the subtitles stay there .
B: <gap> <disfmarker> But if you push the teletext button twice <disfmarker>
D: I think that's the case on most <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound> What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . <vocalsound>
B: It's uh <disfmarker> One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .
A: Ah that's not really that <disfmarker>
D: Well ,
D: that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
C: Yeah . Okay .
D: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people ,
D: who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .
C: No .
B: Yeah .
D: Holding a remote with <vocalsound> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
A: No .
C: <vocalsound>
D: With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel .
A: I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .
A: If you just make it real simple .
A: Because it saves it saves a lot of money .
A: And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen ,
A: which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
D: True . True .
B: Hmm .
A: And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these .
A: Mm eraser ?
A: And we put uh <disfmarker>
A: Looks a bit odd maybe . <vocalsound>
D: That's a pretty big scroll wheel .
A: That is <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Something like that .
D: <vocalsound>
A: Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel .
A: One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one .
A: And these are two buttons then .
C: We could make two buttons out of that .
C: And just um <disfmarker> If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .
A: Yeah .
C: So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .
A: Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think .
A: And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .
C: More obvious .
A: So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll .
C: So
C: if we <disfmarker>
A: That's right .
A: So we've got one , two , three .
A: Yeah ,
A: we can leave the teletext in if we want .
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: That's m that's better .
C: So <disfmarker>
D: So this is five buttons .
C: If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case .
C: And make it smaller overall .
C: So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
A: Y yeah .
A: Mm yeah .
A: Uh yeah ,
C: you get a a much smaller remote .
A: and then you can <disfmarker>
B: Uh yeah .
A: That's right .
C: And it sh
A: So we can decrease this one to four buttons .
C: Yeah ?
D: Right now we have five .
B: But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one .
A: Yeah . That's no problem .
B: Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved .
B: It uh it's a bit uh <disfmarker>
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think .
A: Single curved is really easy to just fill in .
D: Mm .
A: And cases come right out of the machine .
B: <gap> .
A: And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one .
A: I think this is a really easy one . Um ,
A: what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ?
A: Freek , what do you think ?
D: Well ,
D: I still think we should go for the single curve design .
C: Yeah .
D: But then again , <gap> all these changes are not really okay with me .
B: <gap> .
C: Richard's argument was very good . Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: Yep .
D: But since we just have to .
A: <vocalsound>
A: We have to cut costs . <vocalsound>
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah . Yeah
D: I'd rather just go to the board
A: I'm ag
D: and get us to spend <vocalsound> eighteen dollars a a remote .
A: Ask for more money .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .
D: Or do some market research and see what the options are .
A: Yeah .
A: But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more .
C: Yep .
D: Yeah .
A: So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions ,
B: Yeah .
A: it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button .
A: It will be necessary to have good help function , as well .
A: So
A: this is scroll .
A: I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . <vocalsound> Before we went on to the to the whole design .
D: Yes . Definitely . <vocalsound>
B: The th
A: But <disfmarker> I'm glad we could make a bit .
D: Yeah .
A: It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than <vocalsound> this one .
D: <vocalsound> It's pretty different .
B: <vocalsound>
D: But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote .
B: No .
D: This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell .
A: Yeah . It will . Yeah .
B: <vocalsound> But um <disfmarker>
D: 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff .
D: This is not familiar for them .
A: No ,
A: but I think <disfmarker>
D: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
A: I think the most <disfmarker>
B: But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios .
B: Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels .
D: Yeah .
A: That's right .
B: So maybe it's uh <disfmarker>
A: We can let l
A: We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . <vocalsound>
B: Yeah . Yeah .
A: Maybe that's recognisable for them as well .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah . That's a good one .
A: So ,
A: I'm afraid we have to move on .
A: And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think .
A: If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
A: But we will see .
D: That's true .
D: Might uh <disfmarker> might be confusing too .
A: Yeah . That's definitely right .
D: They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?
B: Mm-hmm .
A: Yeah .
B: But very special ,
B: so uh <disfmarker>
A: I would buy it . <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> Yeah .
D: But you're not sixty . <vocalsound>
A: That's right .
A: I would buy it if I was six . <vocalsound>
A: No I don't know .
A: What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ?
A: No ?
A: Uh , yes they are .
C: <vocalsound>
B: No . <vocalsound>
A: No .
A: But we can go on with the project evaluation .
C: <vocalsound>
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Let's see .
A: I can sit down I think .
A: We still have fifteen minutes left ,
A: so we're nice on schedule .
C: Yeah .
A: Um , the project process .
D: So um ,
D: I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
A: Evaluation criteria . That's right .
A: That was the the point I forgot .
A: I should <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound>
A: There we are . Evaluation criteria . <vocalsound>
D: Thank you . <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
A: Go ahead .
A: We've got five minutes I think for those criteria .
D: Five more minutes ?
A: No we've got fifteen minutes
A: but <disfmarker>
D: Okay .
A: Uh yes . What ?
D: 'Kay so
D: I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .
A: Uh yeah .
D: Translated it into criteria ,
D: which would be these .
D: Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel .
D: Innovative ? What new functions are there ?
D: Uh , easy to use ?
D: Uh , learnability is a very important factor here .
D: Uh , is it functional ?
D: Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ?
D: And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ?
D: And the cost .
D: The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ?
D: And recognability . If our company is <disfmarker> If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?
D: And <disfmarker>
D: So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .
A: Okay .
D: Let's see .
D: Oh
D: I have to say this was a little hard ,
D: because the minutes of our last meeting were not here .
A: Yeah ,
A: that's because my pen failed to upload his data .
B: Mm .
D: Okay .
B: Yeah ? <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> I tried to
D: Interesting .
A: but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .
D: So <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
B: Mm . 'Kay .
D: Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
A: I think it's fancy .
C: Six .
A: Yeah . Six .
B: Uh six . Yeah .
D: We all go for six ?
D: Good .
D: Um , is the design innovative ?
A: Very . <vocalsound>
B: Mm . Sh
D: I think so ,
D: with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons .
A: Subtitles , buttons .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
B: <vocalsound>
A: Seven .
D: Seven ?
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station ,
A: huh ? <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> Should be do-able .
A: Yeah . That's right .
D: Is the design easy to use ?
B: Mm . Not really .
A: That's a bit dodgy .
D: Well <disfmarker>
D: Would be for us .
D: But <disfmarker>
B: For old people I I <disfmarker>
A: I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .
C: Four or five . Yes .
B: W
B: Yeah . Four .
D: I'd go for four , too .
B: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: Is it functional ?
D: Is the design functional ?
C: <vocalsound>
D: Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
A: Yes .
C: <vocalsound>
B: N
B: Yeah .
D: I think we do .
D: Do we have too many functions ?
C: No .
A: No .
B: No .
D: I don't think so .
D: It's pretty slim .
A: Think it's uh seven .
D: Seven .
D: Oh ,
D: and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and <disfmarker> R_S_I_ influences ?
B: Mm m
C: Mm , we haven't thought of that one .
A: It was .
D: Think we do .
A: I had them worked out .
A: Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
D: Are the production costs within the preset limits ?
B: Yeah .
D: Well
C: <vocalsound>
D: they are now .
A: Yeah .
C: <vocalsound>
D: Does the design fit the group of focus ?
C: I think that's a three .
B: Mm , th yeah .
D: <vocalsound> Yeah .
A: No
A: I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better .
D: I think it doesn't .
B: Yeah .
B: Uh <disfmarker> We have to test it
D: I don't know .
B: s But <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> I still <disfmarker> I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .
D: I think <disfmarker>
A: I think it <disfmarker>
D: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
B: Uh , yeah , true .
A: Yeah .
A: I would give it a four .
D: I'm not sure .
D: I think I'd go for two .
B: I go for three .
B: So <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Then we have to do the three .
A: It's the <disfmarker>
D: 'Kay .
D: Is the company company recognisable ?
A: Yes it is .
B: Yeah yeah .
D: Well ,
D: we have the logo there .
A: Yeah .
D: So <disfmarker>
A: And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company .
A: And we have the removable front cases .
B: Yeah .
A: So , I think it's very recognisable .
D: Yeah .
A: Yep .
D: So that will be this .
D: I was also supposed to calculate the score ,
D: but thought we would have another private thingy after this .
A: We've got a calculate it .
A: Mm ?
C: Twendag sieven an twendag .
D: Is this <disfmarker>
D: Like
D: after this , are we done ? Or <disfmarker>
A: N
A: We've gonna <disfmarker> We're going to evaluate it .
D: We're gonna go to our other room again .
D: Well , anyhow .
D: These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ?
D: No .
D: Nine ?
A: <gap> Forty nine .
D: Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . <vocalsound> Minus four .
D: So that would be minus eight .
D: Forty one out of forty nine .
A: Forty one .
A: That's <disfmarker> Around eighty percent .
D: Okay .
A: What is it ?
D: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here .
A: That's eighty four percent .
A: I think that's a pretty nice score .
B: Hmm .
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah . <vocalsound>
D: Hmm . 'Kay . So
A: <vocalsound> Okay .
D: that will be the evaluation .
A: Thank you .
A: So ,
A: that brings us to the project evaluation .
A: Yep .
A: Thank you .
D: <vocalsound>
A: Project process .
A: Did we move through the right phases , you think ? <vocalsound> Along the process ?
C: Yes .
B: Yeah .
B: But it <disfmarker>
D: Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase .
B: Yeah .
A: That's right .
A: So lack of information about prices .
D: Yeah . Definitely .
C: Yeah . That's true .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay .
A: Uh <disfmarker> Okay .
A: Satisfaction .
A: Was there room for creativity ?
D: No .
A: <vocalsound> No ? <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
D: Not too much . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound>
A: It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh <disfmarker>
D: Yeah , true .
D: But <disfmarker>
A: The room was <disfmarker> Yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: And I would've liked to go for the younger users also .
B: <gap> .
D: And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own .
B: Mm .
A: Restrictions . Internet access .
A: 'Kay .
A: Leadership .
A: Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ?
C: Yes .
D: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you <disfmarker> two of you with the uh last phase ?
B: So <disfmarker>
C: Yes , was okay .
B: Yeah .
A: Nice .
C: The tasks are very structured ,
C: so you can just do step by step
C: and it's very easy .
B: Mm-hmm .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: <gap> tasks .
A: Okay .
A: Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ?
A: Or were they too much ?
C: Well ,
B: Mm .
C: the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass ,
C: but <disfmarker> The digital the digital pen is very nice .
D: <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
A: Smart-board .
B: Yeah .
A: If it wants to download its uh data . <vocalsound>
D: Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound>
B: But <disfmarker>
C: Yes . Yeah .
B: Uh <disfmarker>
A: Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . <vocalsound>
A: So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ?
C: A flip-over or a more precise uh digit
B: Yeah .
B: A flipper's uh easier ,
B: so <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: Faster as well , I think .
C: Yes .
A: Yeah .
A: Flip-over .
B: But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people .
B: Uh so uh
B: you can sh save it
A: Yeah .
B: uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory .
D: Yeah ,
D: I tried to open the file on my laptop ,
B: So <disfmarker> So <disfmarker>
B: Yeah ?
D: but <vocalsound> not possible .
C: No . Didn't work .
B: No ?
A: Uh you need a smart board uh application I think .
D: Yeah .
B: T can uh can you export it uh like a <disfmarker> Yeah .
A: But I think you can <disfmarker>
A: Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image .
D: <gap> no .
A: Must <disfmarker>
A: Yeah
A: must be <disfmarker>
D: Should've done that then .
A: So
A: the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?
B: <gap> .
D: Pen is here .
C: Yes .
A: Uh , network .
B: Uh <gap> .
A: Yeah , pen is here on the table .
D: <vocalsound>
B: Uh , yeah . So
B: you can <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker>
A: Yeah . <gap> It's possible .
D: Mm . Yeah .
B: It's possible .
A: Okay .
B: Okay .
A: That's nice .
A: Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ?
A: Or <disfmarker>
B: Um , yeah
B: maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh <disfmarker> Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev <gap>
A: Yeah .
B: Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh <disfmarker>
A: Yeah .
A: So <disfmarker> Yeah . So
B: So <disfmarker>
A: everybody puts his own score .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: And then <vocalsound> it mediates the score ,
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: and you can get one <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
A: That's better .
A: So that's uh <disfmarker>
A: How do we call ? Evaluation criteria .
A: Okay . Mm ,
A: any more ideas ?
A: Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?
B: Mm .
A: Because I think then that we get to our last sheet .
A: Are the costs within the budget ?
B: Mm yeah .
C: <vocalsound>
A: Yeah .
D: They are .
C: <vocalsound> Considering we are not going to make a docking station .
A: Do we <disfmarker>
A: Docking station .
A: That's a good point .
B: <gap> .
A: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?
D: Yeah .
A: Uh and I think you can compensate that as well .
C: Perhaps .
B: Mm .
A: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem ,
A: because it's very cheap to make as well .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Yeah .
A: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ?
A: Or what was it ? <vocalsound>
D: Fifty grand .
A: Fifteen fifteen million .
A: I think we will . <vocalsound> If we gonna export this product .
A: It's innovative .
D: Yeah .
A: Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes .
B: Yeah . Mm .
C: <vocalsound>
D: Yeah ,
D: still I think <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
D: I mean
D: if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people .
A: You can do more .
A: Yeah .
B: Ah .
D: So maybe we should just re-focus .
A: Just put it on the market for everybody .
A: You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers .
B: Ah .
D: Or specifically for younger people .
B: Ah .
A: That's one thing you can change it with .
D: That's true .
A: So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works .
A: That's I think a good advantage .
D: Yeah ,
D: I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers .
A: Yeah .
B: Hmm .
A: Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .
D: But <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
B: <gap> <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> Party party .
A: That's it . <vocalsound>
A: Yeah .
A: I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think .
B: Where's the champagne ?
D: 'Kay .
A: I don't know .
A: I didn't get a message
A: from the from ending of the <disfmarker>
B: Uh , I believe y uh <disfmarker>
A: Oh
D: Oh
A: I think I have one now .
D: you did .
A: Five more minutes ?
A: Oh that's nice .
B: Okay .
A: Then we still have some questions .
A: If somebody has some questions they can ask them now .
A: Or we can put these in the project folder as well .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Maybe that's <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
C: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
A: Export as picture , I think .
D: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
A: Hmm . This is another network , I guess .
D: <vocalsound>
A: Does somebody see the project folder ? <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound>
A: I don't .
A: Hmm . My Documents .
B: Uh maybe uh they will save it .
B: So uh <disfmarker>
A: Yeah ,
A: I'll just put it in My Documents
D: Yeah , it probably will .
A: and uh <disfmarker>
A: That's okay .
A: Okay .
A: <vocalsound> I think I'm going to make our final presentation now .
D: Oh yeah ,
D: you're supposed to make a final <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound> And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project .
B: Okay .
C: Okay .
D: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
B: Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire .
A: Yeah . Questionnaire .
B: So uh <disfmarker>
A: I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room .
D: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah . <vocalsound>
A: And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something .
C: Okay .
B: Okay .
A: Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data .
D: <vocalsound> Yeah .
D: That'd be nice .
