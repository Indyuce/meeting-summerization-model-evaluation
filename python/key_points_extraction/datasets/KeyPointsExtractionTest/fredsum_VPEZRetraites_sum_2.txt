In this debate between French presidential candidates Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour, Emmanuel Macron's proposal to raise the legal retirement age to sixty-five is discusse.has been made by the current leading candidate, Emmanuel Macron.

Valérie Pécresse accuses Macron, the current leading candidate, of not fulfilling promises as President but acknowledges the significance of economic issues and the need to replenish pension funds.

Éric Zemmour's program is criticized for having around 150 billion euros in unfunded expenses. He supports raising the retirement age to sixty-four, which he believes would save approximately twenty billion euros. Pécresse, on the other hand, pledges to raise the retirement age to sixty-five except for those with long and arduous careers. She also proposes to increase the minimum pension and widow's pension.

Zemmour's program is further challenged for not having enough substantial reforms. Pécresse argues that cost-cutting related to fighting social fraud, implementing economic tax cuts and cutting social benefits for non-European contributors won't be sufficient to cover deficits and implement fundamental changes. Zemmour defends his approach, stating he will assess needs and make systematic cuts, such as merging certain councils to save money.

Pecresse announces two hundred thousand public job cuts. Zemmour says it's unrealistic, and Pecresse highlights her past success in delivering on her promises to reduce public jobs in her region.
