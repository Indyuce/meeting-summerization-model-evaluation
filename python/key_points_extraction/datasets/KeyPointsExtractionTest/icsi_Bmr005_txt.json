E: So .
E: OK . Doesn't look like it crashed .
E: That 's great .
G: So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working .
G: And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash .
G: So , I won't do that anymore .
B: And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the <disfmarker> without having people have to give their names each time ?
A: Sounds like an initialization thing .
B: I mean it 's like you have the <disfmarker>
G: No .
B: So you know that <disfmarker>
B: I mean , are you going to write down <pause> that I sat here ?
G: I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .
B: OK .
C: Oh , OK .
G: So <disfmarker>
G: So they should be right
G: with what 's on the digit forms .
G: OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits .
G: u
G: And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .
E: And start by giving the transcript number .
D: Transcript <disfmarker> Uh . OK , OK .
A: Tran
A: Oh sorry , go ahead .
E: So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .
H: OK .
E: It 's just uh <disfmarker>
H: Umh .
E: Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have <comment> that information .
G: And I 'm surprised I sort of <disfmarker> I 'm surprised I forgot that ,
G: but uh I think that would be a good thing to add .
E: Yeah , I <disfmarker> I 'd <disfmarker> I think it 's some
G: After I just printed out a zillion of them .
E: Yeah , well , that 's <disfmarker>
E: Um , so I <disfmarker> I do have a <disfmarker> a an agenda suggestion .
E: Uh , we <disfmarker> I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points
E: and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we <disfmarker> we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way
E: and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave .
E: So <vocalsound> uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around
E: and <disfmarker> and uh sort of we have <disfmarker> anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the <disfmarker> the research - y kind of things .
E: Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a <disfmarker> a couple weeks before um uh about the uh <disfmarker> the stuff you were doing with <disfmarker> with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events ,
E: we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events "
E: but I think , you know , what we had meant by " events " I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .
E: But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else
E: like some other noise .
D: Yeah .
E: Yes ?
D: Uh - huh . Yeah .
E: You mean that as an event also .
E: So at any rate you were <disfmarker> you 've <disfmarker> you 've done some work on that
D: To
D: right .
E: and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing .
E: Um , I think especially since you <disfmarker> you haven't been in <disfmarker> in these meetings for a little bit ,
E: maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data ,
E: uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that <disfmarker> that uh <disfmarker> that uh Jane had with Lokendra
E: uh about some <disfmarker> some <disfmarker> some um uh work about
E: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I d I <disfmarker> I don't want to try to say cuz I <disfmarker> I 'll say it wrong ,
E: but anyway some <disfmarker> some potential collaboration there about <disfmarker> about the <disfmarker> about the <disfmarker> working with these data .
C: Oh .
E: So .
C: Sure .
E: So , uh .
G: You wanna just go around ?
E: Uh . <pause> Well , I don't know if we <disfmarker> if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing ,
E: I think there 's just just a couple <disfmarker> a couple people primarily
E: um but um
E: Uh , wh why don't <disfmarker>
E: Actually I think that <disfmarker> that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly
E: so why don't you <disfmarker> you start with that .
B: OK .
B: Shall I <disfmarker> shall I just start ?
E: Yeah , just explain what it was .
B: OK .
B: Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of <disfmarker> you know , relating to his <disfmarker> to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures ,
B: and uh , the need to build in , um , this <disfmarker> this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language .
B: And he gave the example in his talk about how <pause> um ,
B: e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now ,
B: but it 's something about how um , i " Joe slipped " you know , " John had washed the floor " or something like that .
B: And I don't have it quite right ,
B: but that kind of thing ,
B: where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence ,
B: but also the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the causal aspects of the uh floor and <disfmarker> and how it might have been the cause of the fall
B: and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it
B: and it <disfmarker> <comment> These sorts of things .
B: So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , <comment> and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type
B: and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on ,
B: and um , the question was raised " Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? "
B: And <disfmarker> and Dan Ellis said , " Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now <pause> we really don't need to " .
B: Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ?
B: So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret " ahead of the game " ?
B: You know . So it 's the <disfmarker> it 's <pause> i What you <disfmarker> what you int what you draw <disfmarker> you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording ,
G: Hmm , metaphorically .
B: that um , i that <pause> i we have enough space ,
B: and he continues , like " we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling " .
B: So you have to sort of get the idea that um , " ahead of the game " is sp speaking with respect to space limitations ,
B: that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space ,
B: and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far .
B: But there are a lot of different things like that .
G: So , do you think his interest is in using this as <pause> a data source ,
G: or <pause> training material ,
G: or what ?
E: Well , I <disfmarker> I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him ,
E: so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours
G: Mm - hmm .
E: and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're <disfmarker> already have
G: Mm - hmm .
E: and see , is there anything to this at all ?
E: Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .
E: Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well , this is just the wrong <pause> task for <disfmarker> for him to pursue his <disfmarker> "
G: Wrong ,
G: yeah .
E: And <disfmarker> and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that <disfmarker> that you looked at that <disfmarker> that it 's plausible at least .
B: It 's possible .
B: Uh , he was <disfmarker> he <disfmarker> he <disfmarker> you know <disfmarker> We met and he was gonna go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically
E: Yeah .
B: and then uh meet again .
E: Yeah .
B: So it 's , you know , not a matter of a <disfmarker>
E: Yeah .
B: But , yeah , I think <disfmarker> I think it was optimistic .
E: So anyway , that 's <disfmarker> that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might <disfmarker> might <disfmarker> might come out from some of this .
C: But he can use text , basically .
C: I mean , he 's talking about just using text
B: That 's his major <disfmarker>
B: I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours
C: pretty much ,
C: or <disfmarker> ?
B: and <pause> that wasn't as directly relevant to what he 's doing .
C: OK .
B: He 's interested in these <disfmarker> these knowledge structures ,
D: Yeah , interesting .
B: inferences that you draw <pause> i from <disfmarker>
E: I mean , he certainly could use text ,
E: but we were in fact looking to see if there <disfmarker> is there <disfmarker> is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in this stuff .
E: So .
G: And I imagine that transcripts of speech <disfmarker> I mean text that is speech <disfmarker> probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing .
G: I <disfmarker> I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .
E: I don't know ,
E: probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was .
E: But .
B: Yeah , I don't think I would make that leap ,
B: because i in narratives , you know <disfmarker> I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious ,
G: Mm - hmm .
B: so .
G: Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're <disfmarker> when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel
G: and <disfmarker> And <disfmarker>
B: Oh .
B: That aspect .
G: Yeah .
G: And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .
G: I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying " we 're ahead of the game " <comment> in that <disfmarker> in that context ,
B: Well <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
G: I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .
B: I <disfmarker> you know , I <disfmarker> I had several that had to do with backchannels and this wasn't one of them .
G: Uh - huh .
B: This <disfmarker> this one really does um m make you leap from <disfmarker>
B: So he said , you know , " we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling " .
G: Mm - hmm .
B: And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be <disfmarker>
G: I guess it would be the same .
B: Uh - huh .
B: But there are others that have backchannelling ,
B: it 's just he was less interested in those .
F: Can I <disfmarker>
F: Sorry to interrupt .
F: Um , I f f f I 've <disfmarker> @ @ <comment> d A minute <disfmarker> uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was <disfmarker> was not listening
F: and <disfmarker> So who is " he " in this context ?
C: Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun <disfmarker>
F: OK .
F: So I was just realizing we 've <disfmarker> You guys have been talking about " he " um for at least uh , I don't know , three <disfmarker> three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again .
C: I believe it .
C: Yeah . Actually to make it worse , <comment> uh , Morgan uses " you " and " you "
F: So this is <disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> gonna be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort .
G: It 's in my notes .
C: with gaze and no identification ,
C: or <disfmarker>
C: I just wrote this down .
F: You just wrote this ?
C: Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , " you had some ideas "
D: Yeah .
C: and he never said Li - He looked <disfmarker>
G: Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally ,
C: Right ,
G: aren't you ?
C: so it 's great .
F: Right .
C: So this is really great
D: Yeah .
C: because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation ,
F: Mm - hmm .
C: I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics .
C: Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice .
E: Uh - huh .
E: Could be .
E: Yeah . That would be tou
G: Oh , that would be interesting .
B: Can we
D: Yeah .
C: Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when <disfmarker>
C: Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice .
G: Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis
G: and it would be very hard to tell .
C: Right .
G: Uh .
B: Oh , but you 'd have the <disfmarker>
C: Put Morgan always like this
C: and <disfmarker>
B: You 'd have fainter <disfmarker>
E: Well , these <disfmarker>
B: Wouldn't you get fainter reception out here ?
G: Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ?
G: Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking ,
G: now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking ,
G: I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .
C: But you don't have this <disfmarker> this problem .
B: I see .
C: Morgan is the one who does this most .
G: So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .
E: I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about <disfmarker> and concerns about " oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? " and so on .
G: Lawyers .
E: And so I <disfmarker> so I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh <disfmarker>
B: I am too .
C: Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at .
B: I am too .
G: And we did mention who " he " was .
C: Yeah .
G: Early in the conversation .
E: Yeah .
F: Right , but I missed it .
F: But <disfmarker> it was uh <disfmarker>
G: Do <disfmarker> Sh - Can I say
E: Yeah .
C: Yeah , yeah .
G: or <disfmarker> or is that just too sensitive ?
F: Yeah .
E: Yeah . No no , there 's <disfmarker>
E: No no , it isn't sensitive at all .
B: Well <disfmarker>
E: I was just <disfmarker> I was just <disfmarker> I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it .
B: And in fact , it is <disfmarker> it is <disfmarker> it is sensitive .
E: It 's OK to <disfmarker>
C: No , but that <disfmarker>
C: it 's interesting .
B: I <disfmarker> I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention .
B: I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane ,
B: but they did say <disfmarker>
B: You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says " no individuals will be identified
B: uh , " in any publication using the data . "
B: OK , well , individuals being identified ,
B: let 's say you have a <disfmarker> a snippet that says , " Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about <disfmarker> about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . "
B: Now I mean , we 're <disfmarker> we 're gonna be careful not to have the " wrongheaded " part in there ,
B: but <disfmarker> but you know , let 's say we say , you know , " Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . " or whatever .
E: b But I <disfmarker>
B: Then the issue of <disfmarker> of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and <disfmarker> and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive .
B: So I think it 's really <disfmarker> really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to
B: because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove ?
E: Yeah , well , there 's that .
E: But I <disfmarker> I mean I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way ,
E: because there 's <disfmarker> If uh <disfmarker> You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's <disfmarker> there 's transcripts of radio shows <disfmarker>
E: I mean people say people 's names all the time .
E: So I think it <disfmarker> it can't be bad to say people 's names .
E: It 's just that <disfmarker> i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> of slandering anybody ,
C: But , then it won't <disfmarker> I mean , if we <disfmarker> if we <disfmarker>
E: but <disfmarker>
G: It 's not a meeting .
C: Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if <disfmarker> if we weren't being recorded .
E: Yeah .
E: Right , so I <disfmarker> So my behavior is probably not natural .
E: So .
C: " If Person X <disfmarker> "
B: Well , my feeling on it was that it wasn't really important who said it ,
B: you know .
E: Yeah .
F: Well , if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the <pause> people who do that to mark
G: Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .
G: If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name .
F: Right .
G: And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that .
E: Yeah , we really can't .
E: But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push <disfmarker> finish this off .
B: I understand .
B: No I just <disfmarker> I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially .
E: So it 's <disfmarker>
B: So , we need to talk about this later .
E: Yeah , I di I didn't intend it an a policy though .
E: It was <disfmarker> it was just it was just unconscious <disfmarker> well , semi - conscious behavior .
B: Uh - huh .
E: I sorta knew I was doing it but it was <disfmarker>
F: Well , I still don't know who " he " is .
E: I <disfmarker> I do I don't remember who " he " is .
C: No , you have to say , you still don't know who " he " is , with that prosody .
E: Ah .
E: Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point <comment> and we were talking about Lokendra at another point .
F: Oh .
B: Yeah , depends on which one you mean .
E: And I don't <disfmarker> I don't remember which <disfmarker> which part .
C: It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK .
E: Uh , I think <disfmarker>
G: Well , the inference structures was Lokendra .
F: But no . The inference stuff was <disfmarker> was <disfmarker> was Lokendra .
F: OK .
E: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
F: That makes sense , yeah .
E: Um <disfmarker>
C: And the downsampling must have been Dan .
G: Yeah .
E: Good <disfmarker>
E: Yeah .
C: It 's an inference .
E: Yeah , you could do all these inferences ,
G: Yeah .
E: yeah .
E: Yeah .
E: Um , I <disfmarker> I would like to move it into <disfmarker> into uh what Jose uh has been doing
E: because he 's actually been doing something .
B: Yeah .
D: Uh - huh .
E: So . <vocalsound> Right .
D: OK .
F: As opposed to the rest of us .
D: Well - <comment> <vocalsound> OK .
D: I <disfmarker> I remind that me <disfmarker> my first objective eh , in the project is to <disfmarker> to study difference parameters
D: to <disfmarker> to find a <disfmarker> a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded .
D: But eh , <vocalsound> tsk , <comment> <vocalsound> ehhh <comment> In that way <comment> I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I begin to <disfmarker> to study and to analyze the ehn <disfmarker> the recorded speech eh the different session
D: to <disfmarker> to find and to locate and to mark eh the <disfmarker> the different overlapping zone .
D: And eh so eh I was eh <disfmarker> I am transcribing the <disfmarker> the first session
D: and I <disfmarker> I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events ,
D: eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap ,
D: eh <disfmarker> <comment> I don't know what is the different names eh you use to <disfmarker> to name the <disfmarker> the <pause> n speech
A: Nonspeech sounds ?
D: Yeah .
G: Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail .
G: So .
D: Yeah .
D: Eh , <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I do I don't need to <disfmarker> to <disfmarker> to mmm <vocalsound> <disfmarker> to m to label the <disfmarker> the different acoustic ,
D: but I prefer because eh I would like to <disfmarker> to study if eh , I <disfmarker> I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping
D: I would like to <disfmarker> to <disfmarker> to test these parameters eh with the <disfmarker> another eh , eh acoustic events ,
D: to nnn <disfmarker> <vocalsound> to eh <disfmarker> to find what is the ehm <disfmarker> the false <disfmarker> eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the <disfmarker> the ehm <disfmarker> this eh parameter <disfmarker> eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature <disfmarker>
G: Mm - hmm .
A: You know <disfmarker> I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there .
G: So it was <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
A: I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you wouldn't necessarily <disfmarker> or , you know , something like that , it 'd be <disfmarker> it might be hard to know that it was two separate events .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
G: Well <disfmarker> You weren't talking about just overlaps
D: Ye
G: were you ?
G: You were just talking about acoustic events .
D: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general ,
G: Someone starts , someone stops <disfmarker>
G: Yeah .
D: but eh my <disfmarker> my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone .
A: Oh .
G: Mm - hmm .
D: Eh ? <comment> n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events .
E: How many overlaps were there uh in it ?
E: No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ?
D: How many ?
D: Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session
G: Oh , God !
D: in five <disfmarker> eh in forty - five minutes .
G: Ugh .
A: Three hundred overlapping speech <disfmarker>
D: Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone .
C: Overlapping speech .
D: With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech <disfmarker> speech what eh different duration .
A: Mm - hmm .
E: Sure .
B: Does this <disfmarker> ?
B: So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ?
D: Yeah , three people , two people .
D: Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background ,
D: be
E: No no , but I think what she 's asking is <pause> if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ?
D: Oh .
D: Oh .
D: Yeah .
D: I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone .
D: This <disfmarker> th I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I con I consider <disfmarker> I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh <disfmarker> are talking together .
G: Well <disfmarker> So let 's <disfmarker>
B: For
G: So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time ,
G: and then Liz starts talking also over all of us .
G: How many events would that be ?
D: So - I don't understand .
G: So , two people are talking , <comment> and then a third person starts talking .
D: Yeah ?
G: Is there an event right here ?
D: Eh no . No no .
D: For me is the overlapping zone ,
D: because <disfmarker> because you <disfmarker> you have s you have more one <disfmarker> eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in a moment .
G: So i if two or more people are talking .
E: I see .
E: OK .
E: Yeah . So I think <disfmarker> Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .
D: Yeah .
E: So then , in the region between <disfmarker> since there <disfmarker> there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking .
D: If
D: Uh - huh .
E: And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event .
E: Is it <disfmarker> Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ,
D: Uh - huh .
D: Yeah .
E: or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?
D: I consider the <disfmarker> the , nnn <disfmarker> the nnn , nnn <disfmarker> eh , the entirety
D: eh , eh , all <disfmarker> all the time there were <disfmarker> the voice has overlapped .
E: OK .
D: This is the idea .
D: But eh I <disfmarker> I don't distinguish between the <disfmarker> the numbers of eh speaker .
D: Uh , I 'm not considering <vocalsound> eh the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> ehm <vocalsound> eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ?
D: Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking ,
D: and eh , eh a third person eh join to <disfmarker> to that .
D: For me , it 's eh <disfmarker> it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event .
D: Wi - but <disfmarker> uh , without any mark between the zone <disfmarker> of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together ,
D: and the zone with the three speakers .
B: That would j just be one .
D: It <disfmarker> One . One .
B: OK .
D: Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark .
E: Got it .
D: Because eh <vocalsound> for me , is the <disfmarker> is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral .
D: I don't mind <disfmarker> By the moment , by the moment .
G: Well , but <disfmarker> But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .
D: I <disfmarker> I don't <disfmarker>
D: Yeah , but eh <disfmarker> but eh I have to study . <comment> What will happen in a general way ,
E: Could .
G: So . You had to start somewhere .
E: Yeah . We just w
D: I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't know what eh will <disfmarker> will happen with the <disfmarker>
C: So there 's a lot of overlap .
G: Yep .
C: So .
G: That 's a lot of overlap ,
G: yeah ,
E: So again , that 's <disfmarker> that 's three <disfmarker> three hundred in forty - five minutes that are <disfmarker> that are speakers , just speakers .
G: for forty - five minutes .
D: Yeah ?
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
E: Uh - huh . OK . Yeah .
B: But a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a th
E: So that 's about eight per minute .
B: But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's <disfmarker>
D: Yeah , <pause> but <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
C: But that can include taps .
E: Uh . Yeah .
D: But <disfmarker>
B: Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot .
D: General .
C: Actually <disfmarker>
D: I <disfmarker> I con I consider <disfmarker> I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too .
B: Silent .
G: Silence starting or silence ending <disfmarker>
D: Yeah , silent , ground
D: to <disfmarker> bec to detect <disfmarker> eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .
C: Oh , OK .
E: Mm - hmm .
A: Oh .
D: In ge in <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in a general point of view .
C: Oh .
E: OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ?
C: Alright .
F: Not speech <disfmarker> not speech or too much speech .
D: in the per
D: Too much speech .
E: Right .
E: So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ?
D: Yeah .
D: Uh silent ,
D: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I don't <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I haven't the <disfmarker>
D: eh I <disfmarker> I would like to <disfmarker> to do a stylistic study
E: Yeah .
D: and give you eh with the report eh from eh the <disfmarker> the study from the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the session <disfmarker> one session .
E: Yeah .
E: Yeah .
D: And I <disfmarker> I found that eh another thing .
D: When eh <vocalsound> eh I w I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file ,
D: um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm <disfmarker> the mixed file , to <disfmarker> to transcribe , the <disfmarker> the events and the words , I <disfmarker> I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike <disfmarker> eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh <disfmarker> collected by headphone .
G: Yep .
G: Right .
D: And <disfmarker> It 's right .
E: Yeah .
D: But the problem is <vocalsound> the following .
D: The <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker>
D: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different ,
D: but eh the <disfmarker> the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by <disfmarker> by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file .
D: And so if <disfmarker> when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn <disfmarker> the mixed file , it 's possible <disfmarker> eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system ,
D: it 's possible you eh <disfmarker> in the eh
D: i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh <disfmarker> to nnn <disfmarker> to do the experiments <pause> with the <disfmarker> the system ,
E: Mm - hmm .
G: Right .
D: its possible to evaluate eh , eh <disfmarker> or to consider eh acoustic events that <disfmarker> which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the <disfmarker> by the mike .
G: Right .
G: The <disfmarker> the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea .
D: It 's a good idea I think .
G: So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
G: I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: So and I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh <disfmarker> to eh <disfmarker> to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal .
G: So .
D: I mean the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the signal collected by the <disfmarker> eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to <disfmarker> to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech
E: Mm - hmm .
E: The <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the far - field ,
E: yeah .
D: you have to <disfmarker> to analyze <disfmarker>
D: you have to <disfmarker> to process .
D: Because I <disfmarker> I found a difference .
E: Yeah , well , just <disfmarker> I mean , just in that <disfmarker> that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that <disfmarker> that we <disfmarker> we passed on to others a few months ago ,
E: there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time
E: and <disfmarker> and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could .
E: So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study <disfmarker> if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike .
F: That 's good .
E: On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,
D: Yeah .
E: so it 's <disfmarker>
C: But why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?
G: If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me ,
G: but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling .
G: And so if you 're interested in <disfmarker>
C: I <disfmarker> I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem ,
E: Some <comment> of it 's masking <disfmarker> masked .
D: Yeah .
A: Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?
E: Right .
G: Right .
C: right ?
G: Although the other issue is that the <pause> mixed close - talking mikes <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
G: I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .
C: But it 's known .
D: Yeah .
G: Yep .
C: I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation
G: Right .
C: isn't it ,
C: over the whole meeting .
G: Yep .
C: So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem .
D: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think eh
D: I saw the nnn <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> eh
D: but eh I eh <disfmarker> I have eh any results .
D: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I saw the <disfmarker> the speech file collected by eh the fet mike ,
D: and eh eh signal eh to eh <disfmarker> to noise eh relation is eh low .
E: Mm - hmm .
D: It 's low .
D: It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone .
G: Yep .
D: And
D: I <disfmarker> I found that nnn <disfmarker> that eh , <vocalsound> ehm , pr probably ,
G: Did <disfmarker> Did you
D: I 'm not sure eh by the moment ,
D: but it 's <disfmarker> it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , <vocalsound> eh
D: for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in several eh parts of the files where you <disfmarker> you can find eh , eh <vocalsound> eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the <disfmarker> in the meeting ,
E: Mm - hmm .
E: Mm - hmm .
D: it 's probably in <disfmarker> in that eh <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in those files you <disfmarker> you can not find <disfmarker> you can not process
D: because eh it 's confused with <disfmarker> with noise .
E: Mm - hmm .
D: And there are <vocalsound> a lot of
D: I think .
D: But I have to study with more detail .
D: But eh my idea is to <disfmarker> to process only <pause> nnn , this eh <disfmarker> nnn , this kind of s of eh speech .
D: Because I think it 's more realistic .
D: I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh <disfmarker>
G: Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll <disfmarker> it 'll be a lot harder .
E: No <disfmarker> i
E: Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your <disfmarker> if i if <disfmarker> if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people <disfmarker> people 's speech , you will <disfmarker> you will get that somewhat better .
D: Yeah .
D: Mm - hmm . Yeah .
E: Um , Are you making any use <disfmarker>
E: uh you were <disfmarker> you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed .
E: Does it uh <disfmarker>
D: With <disfmarker> By Jane .
E: Yes .
D: Yeah .
E: Now um did you make any use of that ?
E: See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
E: Do you <disfmarker>
D: The <disfmarker> the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I want to use to <disfmarker> to nnn , <vocalsound> eh to put <disfmarker>
D: i i it 's a reference for me .
D: But eh the transcription <disfmarker> eh for example , I <disfmarker> I don't <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I 'm not interested in the <disfmarker> in the <disfmarker> in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in <disfmarker> eh follow in the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> in the <disfmarker> in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker ,
D: in the <disfmarker> in the meeting ,
D: um eh she <disfmarker> she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh <disfmarker> there is an overlapping zone .
E: Mm - hmm .
D: But eh there isn't any <disfmarker> any mark , time <disfmarker> temporal mark , to <disfmarker> to c eh <disfmarker> to mmm <vocalsound> <disfmarker> e - heh , to label <comment> the beginning and the end of the <disfmarker> of the
E: OK .
E: Right , so she is <disfmarker>
D: ta I 'm <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think eh we need this information to
E: Right .
E: So the twelve <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> it took you twelve hours <disfmarker> of course this included maybe some <disfmarker> some time where you were learning about what <disfmarker> what you wanted to do ,
E: but <disfmarker> but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your
G: Twelve minutes .
D: Twelve minutes .
E: s Twelve minutes !
D: Twelve minutes .
D: Twelve .
E: I thought you did forty - five minutes of <disfmarker>
D: No , forty - five minutes is the <disfmarker> is the session ,
D: all the session .
E: Oh , you haven't done the whole session .
B: Oh .
D: Yeah ,
E: This is just twelve minutes .
D: all is the <vocalsound> the session .
E: Oh .
D: Tw - twelve hours of work to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part <disfmarker> of f
E: So <comment> let me back up again .
E: So the <disfmarker> when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ,
D: Yeah .
E: that 's in twelve minutes ?
D: No no no .
D: I <disfmarker> I consider all the <disfmarker> all the session because eh I <disfmarker> I count the nnn <disfmarker> the nnn <disfmarker> the overlappings marked by <disfmarker> by Jane ,
E: Oh , OK .
E: OK .
B: Oh , I see .
D: in <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> in the <pause> fin in <disfmarker> in the <pause> forty - five minutes .
E: So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes ,
E: but you have <disfmarker> you have time uh , uh marked <disfmarker> twelve minute <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .
D: Yeah .
E: Got it .
G: Well , not just the overlaps , everything .
F: So , can I ask <disfmarker> <vocalsound> can I ask whether you found <disfmarker> uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as <disfmarker>
F: you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ?
D: But , by <disfmarker> by the moment , I <disfmarker> I don't compare , my <disfmarker> my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I <disfmarker> I want to do it .
D: Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the <disfmarker> in the marks ,
D: I <disfmarker> and if I <disfmarker> I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I can correct and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .
E: Yeah .
G: Well , also Jane <disfmarker> Jane was doing word level .
E: Yeah .
G: So we weren't concerned with <comment> exactly when an overlap started and stopped .
D: Yeah .
F: Right . Right .
F: I 'm expect I 'm not expecting <disfmarker>
D: Well <disfmarker>
C: Well , not only a word level , but actually
C: I mean , you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption ,
D: No , it 's <disfmarker>
C: you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or <disfmarker>
G: Right .
E: Mm - hmm .
G: Yep .
D: Yeah .
B: Well <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
B: Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin .
B: So my <disfmarker> my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , <pause> beginning and end point .
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: Right .
D: Yeah .
B: And <disfmarker> and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,
B: but , yeah , w it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that <disfmarker> i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken ,
D: Yeah .
B: it would have <disfmarker> it would have been hard with the interface that we have .
G: Right .
B: Now , my <disfmarker> a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface ,
D: Uh - huh .
D: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> It 's <disfmarker> it 's a good eh work ,
B: but <disfmarker>
D: but eh I think we need eh eh more information .
F: No , of course .
F: I expect you to find more overlaps than <disfmarker> than Jane
B: Yeah .
G: Always need more for <disfmarker>
D: No , no . I <disfmarker> I have to go to <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
F: because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level .
D: I want eh <disfmarker> I wanted to eh compare the <disfmarker> the transcription .
G: But if it takes sixty to one <disfmarker>
E: I have <disfmarker>
E: Well , I but I have a suggestion about that .
E: Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things
E: which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting ,
E: but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s
E: how <disfmarker> how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?
D: Only .
E: Yes .
E: Do not mark any other events ,
D: Yeah .
E: but only mark speaker <disfmarker>
D: Uh - huh .
E: Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?
D: OK .
D: OK . I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I w I <disfmarker> I wanted to <disfmarker>
E: Do y do you think that would speed it up ?
E: Uh , speed up your <disfmarker> your <disfmarker> your marking ?
D: nnn , I don't understand very .
E: It took you a long time <pause> to mark twelve minutes .
D: Yeah .
D: Oh , yeah , yeah .
E: Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three <disfmarker>
D: On - only to mark <disfmarker> only to mark overlapping zone , but <disfmarker>
E: Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?
D: Oh ,
D: yeah .
E: Yeah OK .
D: Sure .
D: Yeah sure .
E: Then I think it 's a good idea .
E: Then I think it 's a good idea , because it
D: Sure sure .
D: Sure ,
D: because I <disfmarker> I need a lot of time to <disfmarker> to put the label or to do that .
D: Yeah .
E: Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .
G: And
D: Uh - huh .
E: There 's <disfmarker> there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth ,
E: and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth
D: Yeah .
E: and <disfmarker> and something in between with paper rustling .
E: We know that all that 's there
E: and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study ,
E: but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .
D: Yeah .
E: Whereas th i I would think that uh you <disfmarker> we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .
D: Uh - huh .
D: OK .
E: So . Then you can get the <disfmarker> Cuz you need <disfmarker>
D: OK .
E: If it 's three hundred uh <disfmarker> i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
E: And <disfmarker> and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of <disfmarker> of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics .
G: Right .
C: Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the <disfmarker>
G: Well , that 's <disfmarker>
G: That 's what I was gonna bring up .
C: I mean , you shouldn't need to do this p completely by hand ,
E: Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .
C: right ?
C: I 'm sorry .
E: So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures
E: such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as <disfmarker>
E: I mean there 's a bunch of things <disfmarker> I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .
C: Mm - hmm .
C: In the far - field mike .
E: Yeah .
C: Oh , OK .
E: Um , and uh , it 's not obvious ,
E: I mean , you could <disfmarker> you could do the dumbest thing and get <disfmarker> get it ninety percent of the time .
E: But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the <disfmarker> you know , the right detector .
E: So the idea is to have some ground truth first .
E: And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say " OK this , i you know , it 's <disfmarker> it 's really here " .
A: But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?
C: What I mean is <pause> get it from the close - talking mikes .
E: Uh , yeah .
C: A or ge get a first pass from those ,
E: We t we t w we t we talked about that .
C: and then go through sort of <disfmarker>
C: It 'd be a lot faster probably to <disfmarker>
F: And you can <disfmarker>
G: Yeah , that 's his , uh <disfmarker>
E: We <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> we talked about that .
E: s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,
C: Yeah , I just <disfmarker>
E: the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway ,
E: and <disfmarker> and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,
C: Right .
E: and we could <disfmarker> Uh
E: it 's a question of what you bootstrap from .
E: You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better ,
E: or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then <disfmarker> then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike .
E: I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .
C: Well , that 's what I wonder , because um <disfmarker>
C: or how bad it is ,
E: Well
G: I 'm working on a program to do that , and <disfmarker>
C: be um , because that would be interesting
C: especially because the bottleneck is the transcription .
C: Right ?
C: I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for .
C: We have the audio data ,
E: Yeah .
C: we have the close - talking mike ,
C: so I mean it seems like one kind of project
C: that 's not perfect , but <disfmarker>
C: um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know ,
C: if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech ,
E: Right , we discussed that .
C: you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ?
G: And <disfmarker>
B: Oh .
G: I 've <disfmarker> I 've written a program to do that ,
C: OK ,
G: and it , uh <disfmarker>
C: I 'm sorry I missed the <disfmarker>
E: It 's OK .
G: and <disfmarker> so <disfmarker> but it 's <disfmarker> it 's doing something very , very simple .
G: It just takes a threshold , based on <disfmarker> on the volume ,
C: Uh - huh .
F: Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .
C: Right ,
C: by hand . Yeah .
F: Yeah .
G: um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs .
G: And , it seems to work ,
G: I 've <disfmarker> I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something ,
G: and I haven't <disfmarker>
G: I don't <disfmarker> what I 'm working on <disfmarker> was working on <disfmarker> was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , <pause> into Transcriber .
G: And so <disfmarker> I told <disfmarker> I said it would take about a day .
G: I 've worked on it for about half a day ,
H: I have to go .
G: so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .
C: OK .
E: See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working ,
E: because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,
C: Right .
C: I 'm sorry .
C: I just <disfmarker>
E: but I couldn't remember all of it .
C: It
E: So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when <disfmarker> when he <disfmarker> he gets his thing going ,
G: But <disfmarker>
E: uh , and <disfmarker>
C: Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it .
C: I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of <disfmarker>
E: That was <disfmarker> that was exactly the notion that <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> that we discussed .
B: Mm - hmm .
C: OK .
G: Thanks .
B: Another thing we discussed was um that <disfmarker>
E: So .
C: It looks good .
C: I 'll be in touch .
C: Thanks .
E: S See ya .
E: Yeah .
B: Was that um there m <pause> there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , <comment> that uh handle bleedthrough ,
B: I mean cuz you have this <disfmarker> this close <disfmarker> you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .
G: Yeah ,
G: and I haven't tried using that .
G: It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that .
G: It 's a cross - correlation filter .
G: So I <disfmarker> I haven't tried that , but that <disfmarker> If <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> it might be something <disfmarker> it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .
B: So , some thought of maybe having <disfmarker>
B: Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours .
G: Exactly . Yep .
E: But <disfmarker> but that 's a refinement
B: That 's what we were discussing .
E: and I think we wanna see <disfmarker> try the simple thing first ,
E: cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first .
G: Yep .
E: But uh , having <disfmarker> having somebody have some experience , again , with <disfmarker> with uh <disfmarker> with marking it from a human standpoint ,
E: we 're <disfmarker> I mean , I don't expect Jose to <disfmarker> to do it for uh f fifty hours of <disfmarker> <comment> of speech ,
E: but I mean we <disfmarker> <comment> if uh <disfmarker> if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .
D: Yeah . Sure .
D: Sure .
E: And when <disfmarker> when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .
C: Oh yeah , definitely .
A: You know , I did <disfmarker> I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well .
A: I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs .
A: And uh ,
A: you know , you can <disfmarker>
G: It seemed like the right thing to do .
A: Yeah . I mean , you <disfmarker> you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close .
G: That was with zero literature search .
A: And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to <disfmarker> to do it .
G: That 's good validation .
A: Yeah .
B: Is this proprietary ?
G: Yeah , do you have a patent on it ?
A: Uh . <comment> No . No .
A: It was when I was working for the government .
E: Oh , then everybody owns it .
E: It 's the people .
B: Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt ,
B: or is it <disfmarker> ?
B: No .
A: Nah .
B: OK .
E: Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think <disfmarker> I think it 's <disfmarker>
A: Yeah , he 's <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> it doesn't take a long time .
B: Right .
B: I just thought if it was tried and true , then <disfmarker> <comment> and he 's gone through additional levels of <disfmarker> of development .
G: Just output .
G: Although if you <disfmarker> if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter <disfmarker>
A: Oh ! <comment> I have to remember .
A: I 'll think about it ,
A: and try to remember .
F: And it might be different for government people .
G: That 's alright .
E: Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say .
C: They <disfmarker> they <disfmarker>
A: Di - dif different <disfmarker> different bandwidth .
F: They
G: I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , <comment> sorts of numbers .
F: OK .
E: Uh , I don't know , it <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> if we want to uh <disfmarker>
E: So , uh , maybe we should move on to other <disfmarker> other things in limited time .
B: Can I ask one question about his statistics ?
B: So <disfmarker> so in the tw twelve minutes , um , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i Um , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps .
E: Yeah .
B: Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or <disfmarker> ?
D: More than ?
B: More than <disfmarker>
B: How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?
D: How many ?
D: Eh , not @ @ I
D: Onl - only I <disfmarker> I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the
E: Yeah .
D: but eh I <disfmarker> I don't co eh <disfmarker> I don't count eh the <disfmarker> the overlap .
B: The overlaps .
B: OK .
D: I consider I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> the nnn <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> the three hundred is eh considered only you <disfmarker> your transcription .
D: I have to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> to finish transcribing .
D: So .
G: I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than <disfmarker> than sort of the middle .
D: Yeah .
G: Middle or end .
D: Yeah .
G: Because i we 're <disfmarker> we 're dealing with the <disfmarker> Uh , in the early meetings ,
B: I 'm not sure .
G: we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , <comment> and things like that ,
D: Yeah .
G: and that seems to be a lot of overlap .
D: Yeah .
B: I think it 's an empirical question .
B: I think we could find that out .
D: Yeah .
G: Yep .
B: I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm not sure that the beginning had more .
E: So <disfmarker> so I was gonna ask , I guess about any <disfmarker> any other things that <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> that either of you wanted to talk about ,
E: especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes ,
E: that <disfmarker> that you wanna go with .
C: Can I just ask about the data ,
C: like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data ,
C: just cuz I 'm <disfmarker>
C: I wanted to get a feel for that
C: to sort of be able to know what <disfmarker> what can be done first
C: and like how many meetings are we recording
E: Right so there 's this <disfmarker> this <disfmarker> There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .
C: and <disfmarker>
E: That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point .
E: Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM .
E: Right ?
E: And then we don't know .
C: How many meetings is that ?
G: What 's that ?
C: Like <disfmarker> how many <disfmarker>
E: That was about ten hours , and there was about <disfmarker>
C: t ten <disfmarker> It 's like ten meetings or something ?
G: Yeah , something like that .
C: Uh - huh .
G: And then <disfmarker> then we
A: Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ?
C: And <disfmarker>
G: Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the <pause> missing files .
E: Yeah .
E: Oh .
E: Oh , that 's right , that had <disfmarker> those have not been sent .
A: H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ?
E: We 're saying about <pause> twelve hours .
G: About twelve <pause> by now . Twelve or thirteen .
C: Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously
C: we 're only recording this one now ? or <disfmarker> ?
E: No .
G: Nope .
E: No , so the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> that 's the <disfmarker> that 's the biggest one <disfmarker> uh , chunk so far ,
C: OK .
A: It was the morning one .
E: but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys .
G: Jerry .
C: Do they meet every week ,
E: And then there <disfmarker>
E: Uh , they do .
C: or every <disfmarker>
E: w w And we talked to them about recording some more
E: and we 're going to ,
E: uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues ,
E: and we 're recording those ,
E: uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded ,
C: Great .
E: and we 're gonna start recording them .
E: They 're <disfmarker> They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week .
E: So actually , we 're gonna h start having a <disfmarker> a pretty significant chunk
E: and
E: so , you know , <vocalsound> Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff <disfmarker> things like that ,
E: now that uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the things are starting to happen .
E: So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings ,
E: but there are scattered other meetings in it and that <disfmarker> that amount is gonna grow
E: uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately <disfmarker>
E: i if we 're <disfmarker> if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it ,
E: not <disfmarker> not <disfmarker> not eighty or ninety .
E: But .
C: So there 's probably <disfmarker> there 's three to four a week ,
G: That 's what we 're aiming for .
C: that we 're aiming for .
E: Yeah .
C: And they 're each about an hour or something .
E: Yeah , yeah .
G: Although <disfmarker>
G: Yeah .
G: We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .
C: So <disfmarker>
E: Yeah and th the <disfmarker> the other thing is I 'm not pos
C: OK .
E: I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really don't know <disfmarker>
E: maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty ,
E: but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .
G: Right .
E: Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff .
C: Yeah .
E: And , you know , we <disfmarker> we h we 're highly motivated .
E: Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated
E: cuz they 're working on connected digits ,
E: so it 's <disfmarker>
G: Actually that 's something I wanted to ask ,
G: is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .
E: Yeah .
G: We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those .
E: Yeah .
G: And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .
C: Right .
G: But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that .
G: Um , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?
E: Uh , yeah , I <disfmarker> I think
G: I mean , is it something of interest ?
E: definitely s so Absolutely .
E: Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .
G: OK .
G: I mean , I I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm interested in it ,
G: I just don't have time to do it now .
F: I was <disfmarker> these meetings <disfmarker> I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these <disfmarker> this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation .
G: So
G: Yep . Yep .
F: Um .
C: Actually I have o
G: I <disfmarker> I would really like someone to do adaptation .
F: Mm - hmm .
G: So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .
E: Well <disfmarker>
E: I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to <disfmarker> to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,
G: Since it 's the same people over and over .
F: Mm - hmm .
E: to try to get rid of some of the effects of the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the far - field effects .
F: Mm - hmm .
E: Um , I mean we have <disfmarker> the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation
E: because people move around ,
E: and uh , if <disfmarker> if it 's <disfmarker> if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> it 's <disfmarker> you can't really do inversion ,
F: Mm - hmm .
E: and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something <disfmarker> It may <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly
E: and so the tack that we 've taken is more " lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal " .
F: Mm - hmm .
E: Uh , that 's the party line .
E: But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous .
E: It 's good <disfmarker> <vocalsound> good to sort of test them , actually .
E: And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do .
E: So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .
E: Um , there was a <disfmarker> have been some nice talks recently by <disfmarker> by Lucent on <disfmarker> on their b
F: Hmm .
E: the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,
E: uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . <comment> And um , you know , th
A: W what is the um <disfmarker> the artifact you try to <disfmarker> you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?
F: Ciao .
E: Uh so it 's <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> you have a <disfmarker> a direct uh <disfmarker>
E: Uh , what 's the difference in <disfmarker> If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would
E: um <disfmarker>
F: I 'm signing off .
E: Yeah .
E: that would subtract off <comment> the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant .
E: You know , so <disfmarker> so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation <disfmarker>
E: Yeah , so you <disfmarker> Given that um <disfmarker>
E: Yeah , so you 're trying to <disfmarker> So you 'd <disfmarker> There 's a <disfmarker> a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there ,
E: and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections .
E: And if you figure out well what 's the <disfmarker>
E: there 's a <disfmarker> a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself <disfmarker> adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract <disfmarker> essentially to subtract off uh different uh <disfmarker> different reflections .
E: Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had <disfmarker> you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something
E: and then there 's a <disfmarker> there 's an echo .
E: It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .
A: So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .
A: Uh , just the raw data ,
A: you would <disfmarker> you might hear kind of an echo ?
A: And <disfmarker> and then this <disfmarker> noise cancellation would get
E: Well , I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm <disfmarker> I 'm saying <disfmarker> That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . <comment> What 's really happening is <disfmarker>
E: Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech ,
E: but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times .
E: OK ?
E: So now , if you um try to r you <disfmarker> To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons ,
E: but I <disfmarker> but <disfmarker>
E: not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the <disfmarker> the room response ,
E: but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the <disfmarker> the effect of some of the echos .
E: Um , a number of people have done this
E: so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it .
E: So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach .
E: You say I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I want to use this uh <disfmarker> this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos .
E: So you construct a filter , and you have this <disfmarker> this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh <disfmarker> gets subtracted off from the original speech .
E: Then you try to <disfmarker> you try to minimize the energy in some sense .
E: And so um <disfmarker> uh with some constraints .
A: Kind of a clean up thing , that <disfmarker>
E: It 's a clean up thing . Right .
A: OK .
E: So , echo cancelling is <disfmarker> is , you know , commonly done in telephony ,
E: and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you <disfmarker> if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .
A: When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um <disfmarker> some kind of a special speaker phone
A: and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise .
E: Yeah .
A: And then it was uh <disfmarker> And then it would come on and it was very clear ,
A: you know .
E: Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights ,
E: and then it 's getting the sum .
E: So um , uh anyway that 's <disfmarker> that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try <disfmarker>
E: somebody look <disfmarker> And <disfmarker> and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .
E: I think that 'd be enough data <disfmarker> plenty of data to do that with ,
E: and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything .
E: Uh . <vocalsound> Um
B: Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that ,
B: or is it a different type of reverberation ?
E: Brian 's <comment> Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma .
E: Right ?
E: Which is what I was calling the " party line " , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want .
E: We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position ,
E: and there might be , you know <disfmarker>
E: There 's also um
E: oh yeah ,
E: noise .
E: So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .
E: It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays ,
E: Then we 'll figure out the right <disfmarker> the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those <disfmarker> those echos .
E: But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted
E: so that it 's decision about what the right <disfmarker> you know , right <disfmarker> right uh <disfmarker> delays are <disfmarker> is , uh <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> right delayed signal is <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> uh is incorrect .
E: And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a <disfmarker> in a situation that 's very reverberant <disfmarker> <comment> with long reverberation times <comment> and really long delays , it 's <disfmarker> it 's sort of typically impractical .
E: So for those kind of reasons ,
E: and also a <disfmarker> a c a complete inversion ,
E: if you actually <disfmarker> I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .
E: Um , that 's difficult because um often times the <disfmarker> the um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,
E: and so , if you <disfmarker> you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and <disfmarker> and uh goes to infinity .
E: So it 's <disfmarker> so there 's <disfmarker> there 's <disfmarker> there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents <disfmarker>
E: I mean there 's all sorts of <disfmarker> all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical .
E: So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion ,
E: and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,
E: and um we decided to do this approach of taking <disfmarker> uh , just picking uh features , which were <disfmarker> uh will give you more <disfmarker> something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation ,
E: and that 's what Brian was trying to do .
E: So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was <disfmarker> I was gonna bring up .
E: Uh . Let 's see . I guess you <disfmarker> you actually already said this thing about the uh <disfmarker> about the consent forms ,
E: which was that we now don't have to <disfmarker>
E: So this was the human subjects folks who said this , <comment> or that <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> ?
B: The a apparently <disfmarker> I mean , we 're gonna do a revised form , of course .
B: Um
B: but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings .
B: She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form .
B: I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say .
B: So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something .
B: It won't be that many people who do it <pause> that often ,
B: but um just , you know , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , I guess .
E: OK .
E: Um , back on the data thing ,
E: so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that <disfmarker> that we have .
E: We have <disfmarker> we have an hour uh that <disfmarker> that is transcribed ,
E: we have <disfmarker> we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,
E: and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we <disfmarker> if this really
E: uh <disfmarker>
E: Well , do we have that much ?
C: Not really .
E: Let 's see ,
E: we have <disfmarker>
C: It 's three to four per week .
C: So that 's what <disfmarker> You know , that <disfmarker>
E: uh eight weeks , uh is <disfmarker>
C: So that 's not a lot of hours .
E: Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's <disfmarker> Yeah , so like thirty <disfmarker> thirty hours ?
A: Three <disfmarker> Three hours .
C: Yeah .
C: I mean , is there <disfmarker>
C: I know this sounds <pause> tough but we 've got the room set up .
C: Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use
C: well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes .
C: There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that don't require any transcription .
C: So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ?
C: And I 'm really interested in this <vocalsound> but we don't have a whole lot of data .
C: So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up
C: and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,
E: But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .
C: so <disfmarker>
E: Right ?
E: So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .
C: I mean , is there <disfmarker> Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them <comment> or some kind of deci
C: I mean , that are less
C: well <disfmarker> I don't <disfmarker>
C: uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them ,
C: or strong <disfmarker>
G: We had some good ones earlier .
C: There 's laughter ,
C: um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings ,
C: maybe with manager types , or <disfmarker>
G: I think it 's hard to record those .
C: To be allowed to record them ?
E: Yeah , people will get <disfmarker>
C: OK .
B: It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .
B: But I <disfmarker> but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea .
C: OK .
C: Well , if there is , anyway .
E: Yeah , I was gonna mention that .
G: Oh , that 's a good idea .
G: That 's <disfmarker> That would be a good match .
E: Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> uh , I <disfmarker> I 'd mentioned to Adam , and <disfmarker> that was another thing I was gonna talk <disfmarker> uh , mention to them before <disfmarker> <comment> that uh there 's uh <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .
E: Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , <comment> that <disfmarker> that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up
E: and we don't have any say about it
E: and it 's typically one microphone ,
E: in a , uh , uh <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and so it doesn't really give us the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> the uh characteristics we want .
E: Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .
E: But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say " hey you have this panel show , <pause> or this <disfmarker> you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? "
E: And uh they may be willing to record it uh with <disfmarker>
C: With lapel mikes or something ?
E: Well , they probably already use lapel ,
E: but they might be able to have it <disfmarker> it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .
C: Right .
E: It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing ,
E: and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> they start recording , isn't <disfmarker> als also is not going to be this exact setup .
C: Right . No , I think that 'd be great ,
E: So , <comment> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I was thinking of looking into that .
C: if we can get more data .
E: the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , <comment> uh that we could invite them to have like some of their <disfmarker> <comment> record some of their shows here .
B: Wow !
C: Well <disfmarker> Or <disfmarker> The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount
G: Right , as we are .
C: I mean , they 're on the radio ,
C: right ?
C: So . <comment> Um , I think that 'd be fantastic
E: Right .
C: cuz those kinds of panels and <disfmarker> Those have interesting
E: Yeah .
C: Th - that 's an <disfmarker> a side of style <disfmarker> a style that we 're not collecting here ,
C: so
E: And <disfmarker> and the <disfmarker> I mean , the other side to it was the <disfmarker> what <disfmarker> which is where we were coming from <disfmarker> I 'll <disfmarker> I 'll talk to you more about it later <comment> is that <disfmarker> is that there 's <disfmarker> there 's uh
C: it 'd be great .
E: the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and <disfmarker> and permissions and all that .
E: I mean , they already do what they do <disfmarker> do whatever they do .
E: So it 's <disfmarker> uh , it 's <disfmarker> So it 's <disfmarker> so it 's another source .
E: So I think it 's something we should look into ,
E: you know , we 'll collect what we collect here
E: hopefully they will collect more at UW also
E: and um <disfmarker> and maybe we have this other source .
E: But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours .
E: I mean , that was sort of our goal .
E: The thing was , I was hoping that we could <disfmarker> @ @ in the <disfmarker> under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .
E: And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester .
E: And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh <disfmarker>
C: Right .
C: Yeah I was mostly trying to think , " OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with .
C: And you <disfmarker> you wanna s you wanna sort of fr freeze your <disfmarker> your data for awhile
C: so um right now <disfmarker>
C: and we don't have the transcripts back yet from IBM
C: right ?
E: Well , we don't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was <disfmarker>
C: Do <disfmarker> Oh , do we now ?
C: So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now
E: Yeah .
C: and they 're pretty different , because
G: Right .
E: Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you <disfmarker> you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,
C: um <disfmarker>
C: Right .
E: and <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> and uh <disfmarker> and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can <disfmarker> you can do a lot of other things .
C: Right , right .
C: Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend <disfmarker>
C: you know , I don't wanna charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time .
C: And that 's <disfmarker> and especially with the student
G: Right .
C: uh for instance this guy who seems <disfmarker>
E: Yeah .
C: Uh
C: anyway , I shouldn't say too much ,
C: but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person .
C: And so it 's <disfmarker>
E: i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now <disfmarker>
E: Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing ,
E: but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh <disfmarker> which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .
C: And we just don't know about the transcription part of that ,
E: So that 's <disfmarker>
B: Yeah , we need to <disfmarker> I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,
C: so .
C: I mean , it <disfmarker>
B: and uh es especially since these people won't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions .
C: Right .
E: Yeah .
B: So I think that we 'll need to adjust some <disfmarker>
B: And also if we wanna add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through .
B: I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection .
B: There 'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh , you know , friends ,
B: and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to ,
B: right ?
E: If they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @ <disfmarker>
E: I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions ,
E: but I think if it 's a real <disfmarker>
E: Why not ?
E: Yeah .
C: I mean , I 'm thinking , politically <disfmarker>
G: Stage some political debates .
B: You could do this ,
C: Well yeah ,
B: you know . You could .
C: or just if you 're <disfmarker> if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't <pause> um have them do the digits , <comment> or maybe have them do a shorter <pause> digit thing <comment> like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do .
G: We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .
C: Then , having the data is very valuable ,
C: cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it .
C: It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data .
C: Um , whether it 's transcribed or not um , is another issue ,
C: but there 's <disfmarker> there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer .
G: Yep .
B: It seems like you could hold some meetings .
C: So .
B: You know , you and maybe Adam ?
B: You <disfmarker> you could <disfmarker> you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .
A: Would it help at all <disfmarker>
A: I mean , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings .
A: One is uh um without doing the digits <disfmarker> Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits ,
A: what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff .
C: Need the close - talking mikes .
A: You do , OK .
C: I mean , absolutely ,
E: Yeah . Yeah .
C: yeah . I 'm really scared <disfmarker>
G: It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .
C: Um or at least , like , me personally ? I would <disfmarker> <comment> I <disfmarker> couldn't use that data .
A: I see , OK .
E: Yeah .
B: I agree .
C: Um .
B: And Mari also ,
B: we had <disfmarker> This came up when she she was here .
B: That 's important .
E: Yeah ,
C: So it 's a great idea ,
E: I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> b By the <disfmarker> by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .
C: and if it were true than I would just do that ,
C: but it 's not that bad <disfmarker>
C: like the room is not the bottleneck ,
C: and we have enough time in the room ,
C: it 's getting the people to come in and put on the <disfmarker> and get the setup going .
E: I think the issue is just that we 're <disfmarker> we 're blazing that path .
E: Right ?
E: And <disfmarker> and um <disfmarker> d Do you have any idea when <disfmarker> when uh the <disfmarker> you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?
G: Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .
E: Yeah .
E: Yeah .
G: So it 'll be early next week .
E: Yeah , OK .
E: So early next week we send it to them ,
E: and then <disfmarker> then we check with them to see if they 've got it
E: and we <disfmarker> we start , you know asking about the timing for it .
G: Yep .
E: So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .
G: Yep .
E: Right ?
G: Yeah , but <disfmarker>
E: Well <disfmarker>
G: Yeah , who knows where they are .
A: Have they ever responded to you ?
G: Nope .
E: Yeah , but <disfmarker> You know , so they <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> they have <disfmarker> you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do ,
C: What if <disfmarker>
G: Yeah , you <disfmarker> we can't complain .
E: right ?
E: But they <disfmarker> But at any rate , they 'll <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think once they get that sorted out , they 're <disfmarker> they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they <disfmarker> who 's <disfmarker> who is doing it ,
E: and uh I think it 's not going to be <disfmarker> I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour ,
E: I think . It 's not going to be thirty
G: Yep . I think that 's probably true .
C: Really ?
C: So it 's the amount of <disfmarker>
E: It 's <disfmarker> it 's just getting it going .
G: It 's pipeline , pipeline issues .
C: Right .
C: What about these lunch meetings <disfmarker>
G: Once the pipeline fills .
C: I mean , I don't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we don't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , <comment> to record you know , two or three more meeting a week ,
C: just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ?
E: But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and <disfmarker>
C: No , I meant ,
C: um , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs ,
C: maybe they don't wanna be recorded , but <disfmarker>
G: Oh , and we 're just chatting ?
C: Just the ch the chatting .
G: Yeah , we have a lot of those .
C: I actually <disfmarker> I actually think that 's <pause> useful <pause> data , um <pause> the chatting ,
G: Yeah , the problem with that is I would <disfmarker> I think I would feel a little constrained to <disfmarker> You know ? Uh , some of the meetings <disfmarker>
C: but <disfmarker>
C: OK .
C: You don't wanna do it , cuz <disfmarker>
C: OK .
G: You know , our " soccer ball " meeting ?
G: I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting .
C: Alright .
C: Alright , <comment> so I 'll just throw it out there ,
G: That was hilarious .
C: if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it .
E: Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they <disfmarker> because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level .
E: So then that would double <pause> what we had .
E: Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW
E: uh <disfmarker> I mean really m a lot more <comment> than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,
G: Right .
E: so .
A: Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water ,
A: or is that still a possibility ?
E: Uh , <vocalsound> they seem to have some problems with it . We can <disfmarker> we can talk about that later .
E: Um , but , again , Jerry is <disfmarker> Jerry 's open <disfmarker>
E: So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting ,
E: uh Jerry was open to it but I <disfmarker> I s
E: One of the things that I think is a little <disfmarker> a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week .
E: You know ? I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think that <disfmarker> that people are gonna feel uh <disfmarker> are gonna feel a little bit constrained .
E: Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time .
G: Yep .
E: And the <disfmarker> then <disfmarker> so then they can just really sort of try to <disfmarker> put the mikes on and then just charge in and <disfmarker>
C: What if we give people <disfmarker> you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ?
B: Well , you know , I <disfmarker> I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise .
C: OK .
C: Alright , alright , alright .
B: But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you don't want artificial topics ,
B: but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that wouldn't be too artificial .
B: I mean , we could <disfmarker> political discussions , or <disfmarker> or something or other ,
C: No , definitely .
B: and
B: i you know , people who are <disfmarker>
B: Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d
B: it 's like , you know , the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> uh goldibears <disfmarker> goldi goldilocks ,
B: it 's like you don't want meetings that are too large , but you don't want meetings that are too small .
B: And um <disfmarker> a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word .
A: Well , even <disfmarker> I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about
B: We could pay subjects .
A: or what about people in the <disfmarker> in the building ?
C: Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo
A: I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and <disfmarker>
C: Yeah .
C: I mean <disfmarker>
G: I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .
B: Yeah .
A: Oh .
C: Mm - hmm .
G: So I <disfmarker> I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition
C: Alright , well .
G: and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said " well maybe we could have meetings down here " ,
G: but then I got email from them that said " no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . "
G: So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .
A: What about Joachim , maybe he can <disfmarker>
E: But <disfmarker> but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that .
E: And I <disfmarker> I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the <disfmarker> with the radio .
E: Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but <disfmarker>
C: Mm - hmm .
A: You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones .
G: Yep .
C: Well , and they 're already <disfmarker> they 're <disfmarker> these things are already recorded ,
E: Yeah .
C: we don't have to ask them to <disfmarker>
C: even <disfmarker> and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual <disfmarker>
E: n Well <disfmarker>
E: No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded .
E: I 'm talking about new ones
E: because <disfmarker> because <disfmarker> because we would be asking them to do something different .
C: Why <disfmarker> why not ?
C: Well , we can find out .
C: I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in <disfmarker> in LDC
C: getting <pause> data ,
E: Right , that 's the found data idea .
C: uh , and <disfmarker>
E: But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .
C: Yeah .
C: Mm - hmm .
E: And u I think routinely they would not do this .
E: So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere
C: Right .
C: Great . OK .
E: and uh <disfmarker>
E: But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> I might be able to talk them into it .
C: Mm - hmm .
G: Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space ,
G: so we should think about trying to wrap up here .
E: OK . Well I don't <disfmarker> why don't we <disfmarker> why d u why don't we uh uh turn them <disfmarker> turn
C: That 's a good way to end a meeting .
G: OK , leave <disfmarker> leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .
B: Oh .
B: That 's good to know .
E: Turning off the microphone made it crash .
E: Well <disfmarker>
B: That 's good to know .
E: OK .
