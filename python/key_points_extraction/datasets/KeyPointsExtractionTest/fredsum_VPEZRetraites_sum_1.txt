During a debate between candidates Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour, they discuss Emmanuel Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age to sixty-five. Valérie Pécresse criticizes Macron's past performance and his lack of substantial reforms. She advocates for reforms in various sectors and pledges to raise the retirement age except for those with demanding careers. Éric Zemmour supports raising the retirement age to sixty-four and proposes cost-saving measures, primarily related to immigration and social fraud. He argues for a systematic approach to cutting jobs and merging certain councils for savings. Pécresse challenges the funding of Zemmour's promises and emphasizes the importance of economic strength through reforms. The debate involves a back-and-forth exchange of views on the need for reforms and responsible fiscal policies.
