A: Okay , so
A: now we are on the conceptual design meeting .
A: <vocalsound> Uh y getting close to the last
D: Mm-hmm .
A: is the penultim meeting . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
B: How was lunch ? <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> Thanks <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> Mm great . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
D: Don't be sarcastic . <vocalsound> Mark . <vocalsound>
A: So <vocalsound> um
A: I will again do the secretary part
A: uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy .
D: Uh Rama .
C: <vocalsound> Ramaro .
A: Um um we have to take a decision on the control <disfmarker> remote control concepts
A: and we have forty minutes .
B: Mm .
A: So
A: what we want to <disfmarker>
A: the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case .
A: And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements .
A: And at the end um Sammy will give um <vocalsound> a trend watching on what he's <disfmarker> he's been doing .
A: It's <disfmarker>
A: So ,
A: let's go .
A: First with Rama .
A: Participant two .
C: Yeah , participant two .
C: Component .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: Yep .
A: <vocalsound>
C: So
C: we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface .
C: For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities .
C: First one , we can use simple battery ,
C: or we can use <vocalsound> traditional solar cells
C: or <disfmarker>
C: mm and the material we can have plastic ,
C: rubber which is good for this R_S_A_
D: Ah .
C: and then uh titanium , which can be <disfmarker> which have very good look
C: an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display .
C: And we can use some <gap> , moving <gap> kind of thing .
C: So ,
C: as we discussed before ,
C: we need to <disfmarker>
C: we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control .
C: So
C: this can be simple kind of programmable chip
C: and <disfmarker>
C: which can use microphone <gap> sensors .
C: And we also want to look at our remote control ,
C: so .
C: Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to <disfmarker> in our twelve Euros or around that .
C: So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .
A: Mm-hmm , okay .
C: So uh
C: we discussed an <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound> Excuse me .
C: So
C: we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells
C: and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells
D: Mm-hmm .
C: and so we would like to just use simple battery .
C: And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or <disfmarker>
C: and
C: well
C: the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .
D: What is a double-curved shape ?
C: <vocalsound> Like you can have two curves .
D: Uh-huh .
B: Why ?
C: Uh it's <disfmarker> I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic .
C: So ,
C: we want to go for simple push buttons
C: because it need a simple chip
C: and it's really lesser <disfmarker> uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_
D: <vocalsound>
C: which are
C: uh which needs advanced chip technology
C: and it's more expensive ,
C: since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition
B: Mm-hmm .
D: <vocalsound>
C: we want to reduce uh cost .
A: <vocalsound> Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .
D: The cost .
C: Uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> And also like in <disfmarker> if you put a <gap> it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things
A: Okay .
C: and <disfmarker>
A: You m titanium it's more uh <disfmarker>
C: Yeah .
B: W we can use something like you know <vocalsound> the whole body's titanium
B: but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts
B: like
D: Mm like this ?
C: Yeah .
A: Yes so mm <disfmarker>
B: to make it feel better
B: and to
B: you know <disfmarker>
C: Like in cell phones recently
D: Mm-hmm .
C: these <disfmarker> you can <gap> with the rubber in four directions and <disfmarker>
B: <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah .
A: Uh-huh .
A: Okay . <gap>
C: yeah .
C: But full assembly <disfmarker> We'll use mainly for titanium <gap>
A: Okay .
C: rubber is expensive
A: Okay .
C: and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh .
A: Okay .
C: And this push buttons
A: Uh yeah so
C: <disfmarker> we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s
C: and so we want to mo
C: I mean we're <gap> we want to put speech recognition
C: so we want to reduce price on this technology
C: and so that we can have enough space or enough money
A: Okay , s so
A: simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .
C: for <disfmarker>
C: S S
D: Speech <disfmarker>
C: Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology ,
B: Mm-hmm .
A: Okay .
B: Okay ,
C: so <disfmarker>
B: and still we have <disfmarker>
B: mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ?
D: L_C_D_ .
B: L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .
C: Uh l
D: Seems not ,
D: it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .
C: So uh
C: it's like a <disfmarker>
B: No ,
B: it's not gonna be a t no touchable
B: but still like a source of information or source for menus .
D: Ah .
C: Yeah
C: maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design
C: then if we have enough money or like for and <disfmarker>
B: Okay ,
B: so let's try it ,
C: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or <gap> or something
B: let's t
C: so we want to reduce the cost on display
D: <gap> The L_C_D_ would <disfmarker>
C: or this inter
D: The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean .
B: Yeah , yeah ,
B: it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .
D: Just uh for output ,
D: yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider ,
A: <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
C: because like it won't take much money I guess ,
B: Mm-hmm .
C: because <disfmarker>
A: Okay .
C: Okay , yep .
A: <gap> Mm .
C: You have any further questions
C: or ?
D: I guess no
D: um . So
D: the batteries uh are going to be very light .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah ,
C: we're to go for li
C: and now I think we have many options in the market
C: so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries
D: Okay .
B: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C: for really light batteries and with uh good price .
D: So
D: this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically ,
D: instead of clapping why not just be <disfmarker> ask .
C: Yeah ,
C: that's <disfmarker>
C: then the the one thing we want to know is like
C: because remote control is used for like in the household
C: so it it it will be it <disfmarker> m maybe at least five , six people want to use it
C: so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition
D: Mm-hmm .
C: whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent .
C: If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome
C: and we need really m more technology
C: and so <disfmarker>
A: Okay ,
A: for the location .
C: Yeah ,
C: if if everybody in the house n <gap> to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .
A: Hmm .
D: Okay . <vocalsound>
A: Okay . So
A: let's now go to the <disfmarker>
C: <gap>
A: you don't have more question ?
D: No , it's okay .
B: No more questions .
A: Um mm thank you mm .
C: Yep .
C: Thank you .
D: Puts less of constraint on what we can do
D: but
B: Mm yeah , yeah .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: it's always like that .
D: We have dreams
D: and the <disfmarker> in the end we find out that it's not feasible . <vocalsound>
A: Yeah , but <disfmarker> mm .
C: Oh . We have uh some limitations <gap> . <vocalsound>
D: Anyway .
D: <vocalsound> Yeah .
B: But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice ,
D: L_C_D_ .
D: L_S_D_ is something else ,
A: <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound>
B: L_C_ <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
D: and it's quite nice as well . <vocalsound>
B: I'm an artist ,
B: sorry . <vocalsound>
D: So ,
B: So uh ,
B: that's not <disfmarker>
A: Um <vocalsound> yeah .
D: go on uh artist . <vocalsound>
B: I hope that's not too much .
A: Now let's talk about uh interface .
B: Okay . <vocalsound> Uh
B: participant number three .
A: Three .
C: Three .
B: <vocalsound> Uh
A: Which one ? <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: Hmm . <vocalsound>
B: mm mm uh have a look at this <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
B: no it's <disfmarker>
B: yeah .
A: <vocalsound> Okay .
B: <gap> Uh so
B: the concept of the interface .
B: Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls .
B: So let's start with this .
B: We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons
D: <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: and uh we got explanation for every button
B: and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons
B: and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here
B: and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons ,
B: and um power on and off mm I I don't remember
D: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> Mm .
C: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
B: so uh
B: it it it should be
B: maybe this button is power on and off ?
B: Or no <gap> ?
B: I can see nothing .
B: So
B: that's our concept .
B: It's called the millennium remote control .
A: <vocalsound>
D: Let's change millenniums . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> So
B: Yeah .
C: maybe you can use <gap> in the end and <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
D: <gap> doesn't make sense .
D: This is very <vocalsound> ugly .
B: Really ? <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
B: I thought you like it .
D: Oh no ,
B: Ah okay
B: just press the button , please uh . <vocalsound>
D: too much concept .
D: Ah .
A: No .
D: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
C: Uh <disfmarker>
B: Yeah ,
B: we will not use this . We will not use this .
A: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: But instead of this I will devise <disfmarker> That's our concept .
D: Ah ,
D: back today . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed .
A: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
B: And uh what will people say ?
B: They'll say it's perfect .
B: Or what will say ?
B: Uh they will say it's splendid .
D: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: <gap> Do you think it can come in several colours ?
B: And everyone's gonna be satisfied .
D: Or did the <disfmarker>
B: <vocalsound> I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .
D: Um but not the case .
B: Not the case .
D: Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff ,
D: like <disfmarker>
B: Yeah .
C: Mm .
A: Because apparently from your survey people like colours ,
A: no ?
D: Yeah ,
C: Yeah .
D: well
D: they like uh something which is uh <disfmarker>
B: Okay , so
B: let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .
D: Mm yeah , okay ,
D: so that would be the option
B: Do you like it ?
D: . I don't know
D: I don't have a Nokia phone ,
A: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> But it's uh <disfmarker>
D: but
D: I don't use that
D: but again , uh I might <disfmarker>
B: That's why you don't have it . That's why ,
D: Yeah ,
D: bu but <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
B: 'cause it's nasty . <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .
B: No .
C: Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler .
D: Mm-hmm .
C: Maybe we can just <disfmarker>
C: if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .
B: Um , I am here .
C: So users have different <disfmarker> I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so <disfmarker>
A: Okay .
A: So ?
B: Mm-hmm .
C: So we can just <disfmarker>
C: if they want they can just pay another two Euro .
A: Uh-huh , okay ,
B: 'Kay .
A: so
A: you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we <disfmarker> if you want o more colours <vocalsound> on L_C_D_ ,
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah yeah yes .
C: If they want like uh <disfmarker> so that we can <disfmarker>
D: Kind of upgradable uh <vocalsound> remote control .
C: yeah .
A: yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: Wow , wow .
A: Okay .
C: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours .
B: Okay ,
B: what uh <disfmarker>
B: there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um <vocalsound>
B: 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are ,
B: like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature ,
C: Lights , yeah .
D: Mm .
A: And thermodynamic also .
C: Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Like a chameleon .
B: yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah yeah .
B: We can make it in fact .
A: Yeah
C: Mm .
A: but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah .
B: If if if the <disfmarker>
B: okay .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: But uh it can be in uh maybe in an <disfmarker> a gradable version ,
B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,
C: Yeah .
A: but <disfmarker>
D: Because uh I think there are two kinds of people .
B: so <disfmarker>
D: Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful
D: uh I'm going to talk about this later
D: but <disfmarker>
D: and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them
D: so it it's like a signature .
D: My remote control is pink .
D: Nobody else than me has a pink remote control .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: Uh-huh .
C: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> And that makes me special .
D: <vocalsound>
A: Okay
A: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more
A: because of <vocalsound> uh o or this is <disfmarker>
D: <vocalsound> I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .
C: <vocalsound>
A: Okay ,
A: so
D: Those who wanted to have it pink .
A: so <vocalsound>
A: i
C: Uh <disfmarker>
A: it's not uh a s base service
D: No mm no .
C: Mm .
A: it's a <disfmarker>
B: So ,
B: <gap> be an option ,
B: yeah .
A: Mm .
D: It might be optional , yeah .
A: Okay .
C: But those people will be really few ,
C: no ?
C: So like
C: we can <gap> those <disfmarker>
D: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .
C: Ah .
D: Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink <vocalsound>
A: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah .
A: So m so
C: Mm . <vocalsound>
A: maybe that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .
B: <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah ,
D: Mm . Yeah .
B: yeah .
B: But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .
A: <vocalsound> And you'll be different .
C: <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound> And it makes you different ,
D: Yeah , yeah .
B: you know ?
D: You always have your remote .
A: <vocalsound> Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . <vocalsound> Want to change my neighbour .
D: Oh , you don't ? <vocalsound> Yeah . You don't have your remo <vocalsound>
B: Anyone has their remote controls here ?
B: No ? <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: Wh
D: you you know like
D: for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control .
D: <vocalsound> Uh it's white
B: Mm-hmm .
D: and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .
D: It has this distinctive look and feel and look <gap>
A: Mm .
D: which people seems to like <vocalsound>
B: Okay .
D: just because it's <vocalsound> a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .
B: Uh-huh , uh-huh .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
D: Seems important .
C: Hmm .
B: That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light ,
D: Mm <gap> glow in the dark ,
C: <gap>
B: yeah .
D: so <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound>
C: Yeah
C: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something
D: <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
C: so that like <disfmarker> at least um <disfmarker>
C: yeah .
A: Iradium ? <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound> Okay . Okay .
C: <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah ,
D: <vocalsound>
A: Ah sorry . Mm .
C: that <disfmarker>
A: <vocalsound> Okay . So mm <disfmarker>
D: Okay .
B: Okay . S well ,
B: let's go on maybe with the presentation .
D: Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . <vocalsound>
A: Mm-hmm . <vocalsound>
B: And um the remote control's going to be smart
C: Oh .
B: but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?
A: <vocalsound>
B: And uh
C: <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound>
B: I dunno
B: that's a question to you
B: and to mm to <disfmarker>
D: Well so
D: I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done
D: uh so that's the smartness of the thing .
D: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition
B: Mm-hmm .
C: <vocalsound>
D: but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
B: Okay , okay .
C: <vocalsound>
D: I dunno . <vocalsound>
A: Mm , that's a nice world . <vocalsound>
B: <vocalsound> So just just just just think about it um .
D: <vocalsound>
B: <gap> Thank you .
D: Don't touch the remote .
A: Okay .
D: But <disfmarker> yeah .
D: Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ?
D: So
D: for instance the young guy would not be able to use it
D: because his father doesn't want .
B: Uh yeah
D: Like with some <disfmarker>
B: I just want to say it should be real smart .
D: Maybe fingerprint recognition or <disfmarker>
B: <vocalsound> Voice recognition is quite tough .
B: I say don't use it , and the control just looks .
D: Mm .
C: Yeah .
B: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it .
D: Um <disfmarker>
D: Mm .
C: Uh that <disfmarker> mm that could be feasible I guess ,
C: like <disfmarker>
D: Okay .
C: So
C: since we have <disfmarker> we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use <disfmarker>
D: So it could be smart in that way .
C: yeah . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound>
A: Mm .
A: Okay .
D: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have .
D: S since it it knows who is using it ,
D: it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh <disfmarker> things like that
C: Yeah .
B: Yeah , sure .
A: Mm .
C: Yeah .
D: and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow ,
D: I dunno ,
C: Yeah .
D: that might be expensive
D: but
A: Mm-hmm .
C: Uh it's <disfmarker>
D: that might also be a good sales pitch again .
A: <vocalsound>
C: Hmm .
D: <vocalsound> The remote that knows you . <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
B: Mm-hmm . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
A: Okay .
B: Okay ,
B: thanks .
A: <vocalsound> So
D: My turn ?
A: it's <disfmarker>
A: yeah , Marketing Expert .
D: <gap>
D: Okay ,
D: it's alright .
A: Participant two ?
C: Four .
A: Four ,
D: Four , I think .
A: sorry .
D: Trend ,
D: yeah .
D: No uh
D: yes .
D: Okay , so
D: I'm going to talk about trends
D: and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control .
D: So ,
D: next slide please .
D: So
D: first maybe just a small recap on <vocalsound> how how do we watch trends
D: so
D: it's not so uh simple
D: you might think that it's easy
D: but uh it's not so simple .
D: Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know ,
D: so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing ,
D: and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control
D: which basically is a small device that people <gap> have with them , always , like a phone .
D: We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh <vocalsound> example of where to in be inspired .
D: Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also <disfmarker> have also to be inspired
D: because in fact they're not only watching the trends ,
D: they're inventing it , they're creating the trend .
D: I hope I'm going to try to help you on that .
D: This is more risky
D: because you're not following the trend ,
A: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
D: you try to invent it ,
D: which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: So anyway uh
D: next slide please .
D: <vocalsound> Uh to be to be quick <vocalsound>
D: there's a lot of words here
D: but uh basically there are <disfmarker> uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very <disfmarker> pay much attention to .
D: The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel .
D: And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy .
D: Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative ,
C: <gap>
D: it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside
D: and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing
D: which we w may think that would have been the most important ,
D: which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control .
D: So as you see uh <vocalsound> it first have to be very nice ,
D: s something that people are proud of
D: uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with
D: uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff
D: that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours .
D: And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control
D: but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
D: Next slide please .
A: Mm .
D: Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing .
D: If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas
D: so <disfmarker>
D: currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of <vocalsound> of look or feel
A: <vocalsound>
C: <gap> <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
D: or
D: so . <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
D: And I think of course uh <vocalsound> i it applies to everything .
D: That's the thing with trends .
D: <vocalsound> It it can travel f from clothe to furniture <vocalsound> same idea .
A: <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
D: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . <vocalsound>
D: And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy ,
C: Mm .
B: What is spongy ?
D: yeah .
D: Well
D: this <vocalsound> so so I think uh uh i
C: Yeah
A: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound> kind of um maybe <disfmarker>
C: <gap>
D: When we were talking about rubber ,
D: I think uh the rubber aspect might be important
C: Yeah
C: it <disfmarker>
D: because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah .
A: S
C: Yeah .
A: So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .
D: Seems not , seems not .
C: <gap> We need to think about <disfmarker> mm mm .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Yeah .
A: <vocalsound>
D: So <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Um <vocalsound> sorry Mark .
A: It seems to be <disfmarker>
D: Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy ,
C: Fruit .
C: Even shape ?
D: as a <disfmarker>
D: even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound> More <gap>
A: Mm-mm .
C: yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: <vocalsound> Mm .
D: So
D: that's what people seem to <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Hmm . <vocalsound> You're old-fashioned .
D: yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought
A: Sorry . <vocalsound>
D: but that's that's fashion
C: <vocalsound>
D: and <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound>
C: <vocalsound>
B: Okay .
A: Okay .
D: Okay
D: that's all I have to say .
A: Mm you have questions ?
C: So
C: these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ?
C: Or it's <disfmarker>
D: These <disfmarker> I'm sorry .
C: This <disfmarker> you you <gap> so did you <gap> <disfmarker>
D: Yeah , yeah
D: we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course ,
C: Where ?
C: Oh . Oh ,
C: okay , mm-hmm .
D: as you know our company is quite big
D: and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends
C: It's not from <disfmarker>
C: mm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah .
D: that are also <disfmarker>
C: Yeah .
C: It's more general trend
D: well .
C: it's not particular to the remote control .
D: No , it's not it's not <disfmarker>
D: this this is very general , yeah .
D: But it seems that trends travel across things .
C: Mm .
C: Yeah .
D: The <disfmarker> what we <disfmarker>
C: Yeah
C: but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid
C: like they can't be really spongy
D: Sure .
C: or <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
D: We have to <disfmarker> I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables
C: yeah yeah .
C: yeah , yeah
C: sponge ,
C: yeah yeah
C: at least that's <disfmarker>
D: but we still have to put our chips inside , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> of course .
C: Yeah yeah
D: This is your problem .
A: <vocalsound>
C: that <disfmarker>
C: yeah yeah . <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> This is not mine . <vocalsound>
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah ,
C: looking <disfmarker>
C: yeah
C: fruit . These things can be easily incorporated .
C: We can have t colours or this shape
D: Yeah ,
D: I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material .
C: or at least <disfmarker>
D: If if it's something like rubber made or <disfmarker> I think it it's also going to be good .
C: Yeah .
A: Mm .
C: Mm .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Okay ?
C: Yeah .
A: Okay .
A: <vocalsound> No more question ?
A: Okay .
D: Yep . Thanks .
A: So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
A: Okay , so
A: we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again .
A: Um now you have to go straight on this individual action
A: which i which are for Rama uh wil design ,
C: Look and feel de
A: um Mark the user interface design ,
A: and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: <vocalsound> Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .
C: Hmm .
C: Hmm .
C: Mm sounds interesting . <vocalsound>
A: Mm-hmm
A: um and I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .
D: Okay .
B: Okay .
D: Thanks . <vocalsound>
C: So ,
C: can we highlight the specific features of our <gap> <disfmarker>
A: Yeah you're right , you have to <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
C: yeah , so so
C: we want the speech recogniser
C: and we want some kind of buttons
C: and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables ,
C: that's <disfmarker>
A: So
C: we want to follow general trend .
A: you say s
D: Spongy .
A: S
C: Yeah .
A: do we agree on that ?
A: Yeah .
A: We have to .
C: So ,
D: <vocalsound> No , we don't have to ,
C: do you think <disfmarker>
B: So
B: we have to
B: uh for <disfmarker>
A: No . <vocalsound>
D: but seems it's the trend .
C: Hmm . Yeah .
D: Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .
B: yeah
B: so
D: So there's no <disfmarker>
C: Yeah .
B: are we confident enough on creating trends ?
D: Well ,
D: that's <disfmarker>
D: you t can try to convince us .
C: <vocalsound>
B: Well ,
B: we can make it smell like fruit . <vocalsound>
D: Okay . <vocalsound> <gap> that's a good idea ,
A: Okay , <vocalsound> that's a good idea .
C: <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: So titanium smell like fruit .
D: I <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
B: Yeah . <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> Mm-hmm .
D: <vocalsound>
C: So
C: what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ?
C: Or they really like <disfmarker> They more want these fancy features
D: Uh <disfmarker>
D: I think i
D: yeah
C: like <disfmarker>
D: i it's again in this uh
D: what I said first
D: it has to be fancy
D: so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us
A: Mm-hmm .
C: Feature <disfmarker>
C: Yeah .
D: because we have it
C: Yeah .
D: and others don't .
A: Okay .
D: It's fancy .
D: Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . <vocalsound>
C: Yeah .
A: I I agree with uh this uh <disfmarker>
C: Yeah .
A: Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness .
A: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit ,
D: <vocalsound>
A: or do we make spongy uh fruity-like
C: Yeah . Uh
C: we will try to explore these two options
D: Maybe you could explore the two option .
C: and <disfmarker>
A: Mm . Yeah , yeah .
C: yeah yeah .
B: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B: Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean <gap> fruit-shaped .
C: Uh yeah
A: <gap>
C: at least like we can make banana
C: or <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: <vocalsound> Don't you say that you cannot do double shape <disfmarker> uh curved shape <disfmarker>
B: But <disfmarker>
C: yeah
B: Doub double-curved .
D: Mm . Seems to be <gap> .
C: it's it's
C: yeah
A: yeah .
C: that's a <disfmarker>
C: we're to look for <gap>
A: Mm-hmm . Okay .
C: and and s we're to see the <disfmarker> whether rubber is expensive
B: Okay , okay .
C: and d
B: In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the <disfmarker> like titanium panels on a whole rubber body .
C: Hmm .
B: Well , okay
A: Mm-mm . Okay , so
B: w we'll see .
A: you explore now that you're going to work together these these two .
B: Yeah
C: Mm .
A: Or or spongy an
C: Yeah .
A: yeah . <gap>
C: Maybe we can have two different <gap> assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium .
A: Mm .
C: <gap> we have only the plastic or the <disfmarker> the chippy <disfmarker> yeah fibre chips or <disfmarker>
B: We'll see . We'll see .
D: If you have time .
A: Mm .
A: Yeah
A: I don't think w
A: I think we have to choose .
A: If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy
C: Uh .
A: but uh it cannot be both .
B: We'll see .
B: I I really don't like this modelling clay
C: Yeah .
B: 'cause you know it makes some <gap> for for
D: <vocalsound> For creation .
B: I dunno uh <disfmarker>
B: yeah um
C: Yeah .
A: <vocalsound>
B: we'll look .
D: <vocalsound>
C: Yeah .
A: Ah
A: you can pretend that it's uh titanium . <vocalsound>
C: Even design . <vocalsound>
D: You can paint it afterward <gap> .
C: <vocalsound>
B: Okay , okay .
D: No problem .
D: We have a very large department of <vocalsound> paint .
A: Yeah ,
A: do don't worry ,
A: you you <vocalsound> you speak with <disfmarker> mm mm .
D: <vocalsound> You will do it . <vocalsound>
B: Alright , alright .
A: Okay . So
A: explore a shape .
C: So
C: still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or <disfmarker>
C: <gap>
A: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information .
D: Yeah .
C: Okay .
A: Not uh <disfmarker>
D: The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says <disfmarker> if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .
C: Yeah ,
C: then we can <disfmarker>
A: Mm-hmm .
C: yeah , yeah ,
C: that <disfmarker> user friendly
C: or <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
A: Mm .
D: That's the converse to having zillions of button
C: Mm .
C: Yeah .
D: where each button does only one thing .
A: Mm .
C: Yeah .
A: Okay .
C: and we just stick with two batteries
C: so it's not any solar or <disfmarker>
D: Yeah .
D: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel .
C: yeah yeah j yeah ,
A: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C: because <disfmarker>
C: <vocalsound> Yeah .
A: Mm . <vocalsound>
D: Anyway it's very <disfmarker>
D: in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control .
A: <vocalsound> Yeah .
C: <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
D: <vocalsound> So . <vocalsound>
D: Because the trend goes faster than the life of the <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
A: Mm-hmm .
B: Mm-hmm .
A: <vocalsound>
D: So it's <gap> very <disfmarker>
A: Okay .
D: Okay .
A: So
C: Yeah .
B: <vocalsound> Yeah .
A: are we <disfmarker>
D: We're done .
C: Yeah , we're done .
A: mm .
A: <vocalsound> Okay .
A: So see you in thirty minutes .
C: Yep .
