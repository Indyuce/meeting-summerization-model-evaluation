P1: Valérie Pécresse, Éric Zemmour, whether you're assertive, towards each other, that's fine. Be respectful, and let's ensure this debate is heard, it's the least we can do. Today, an important current event has occurred: one of the twelve qualified candidates, Emmanuel Macron, who is currently leading according to polls, has made a proposal. It's related to the economy. He wants to raise the legal retirement age to sixty-five, which is not the case today. You know this. Valérie Pécresse, you have repeatedly accused President Emmanuel Macron of emptying the treasury. Now, he's filling it up again. If he does that, he'll also replenish the pension funds. So, he's repenting. Do you appreciate this measure as it deserves?

Valérie Pécresse (VP): What we see is that what Emmanuel Macron the candidate promises is everything Emmanuel Macron the President has not done. But, on economic issues, it's still very important. Uh, because I know for Éric Zemmour, it's totally secondary, as in his program, he has 150 billion in unfunded expenses.

Éric Zemmour (EZ): Why not a thousand billion while we're at it!

VP: One hundred fifty billion, that's the estimate, right?

Host: He also raises the retirement age to sixty-four.

VP: To sixty-four years, but that's the only reform he's doing. No reduction in civil service jobs, no reform of unemployment insurance. No courageous reforms, no reform of the RSA (social welfare program). Our country needs reforms.

EZ: I remove the RSA for foreigners, isn't that courageous?

VP: There are only five million foreigners in France. It represents only ten percent of the benefits, which is four billion. So, nothing is funded in Mr. Zemmour's program, which promises extravagant expenses.

P1: Let's get back on track, retirement at sixty-five. Valérie Pécresse, the president you may become, will you apply a reform that will more or less approach this? Will you tell the French people, "As president, retirement will be at sixty-five"?

VP: Well, I, I've already said, I will do this reform, up to sixty-five, except for French citizens who are worn out by their work, with a long and arduous career. I said I would do this reform. I said I would reform unemployment insurance, I said I would reform the state. I said I would cut two hundred thousand civil service jobs.

Host: One thousand one hundred euros minimum pension, says, uh, candidate Emmanuel Macron. You say one thousand euros.

VP: No, I say the net minimum wage, because with this reform, I can allocate resources up to the net minimum wage so that no retiree will retire without it. And I propose to increase widow's pension from fifty-four percent to seventy-five percent for widows with incomplete careers.

EZ: It's just copy-pasting, madame.

P2: We're not in a playground. We're not in a playground, so, uh, Eric Zemmour, respond, uh, respond. Valerie Pecresse said that you're not making any substantial reforms, and that your solutions, that is, essentially cutting some expenses related to immigration, wouldn't be enough to, uh, cover the deficits and implement fundamental reforms.

EZ: I never said that. I have been saying, uh, for months, about raising the retirement age to sixty-four. So, it's in the same vein. Uh, it will save us, approximately, according to calculations, twenty billion euros. I do not propose, indeed, you're right, I don't triumphantly announce reductions in the public workforce because, uh, I understood, during the 2017 campaign, that it was all just empty words. Uh, you know, no one fulfills them, ever. They promise a hundred and fifty thousand, two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand, and then, they don't do it. You won't do it.

P1: It can be done, Mr. Zemmour.

EZ: That's what I was going to say. I say, we shouldn't promise, we should, when in power, make a strict assessment of the needs. There are sectors, even Mrs. Pecresse acknowledges it, where we'll need to hire, like the justice system, for example, and healthcare, you agree on that, at least, right? So, there will be sectors where we need to look at excess staff and see where we can cut jobs, etc. But we can't do it just like that, on a whim, saying a hundred and fifty thousand, two hundred thousand, it's all just talk.

P2: But will you do it?

EZ: Yes, but we will have a systematic method, and we'll see. The same goes for decentralization; I propose taking up Mr. Sarkozy's reform, which was to merge, you remember, uh, the territorial council, which was the departmental council, and the regional council, uh, which allows for savings. So, there will be savings. So, I repeat, cutting social benefits for non-European non-contributors is twenty billion, not four billion, Mrs. Pecresse.

VP: There's forty billion, ten percent of forty billion is four.

EZ: You're including the RSA.

VP: The RSA is already like that.

EZ: No, foreigners get the RSA after five years of residence. I'm sorry, after five years of presence, foreigners can get it, so, please, don't act smart. Secondly, there is, there is, there is, the fight against social fraud, which can be estimated at fifteen billion. That's a low figure, as it's estimated between fifteen and forty-five billion, even by the Court of Auditors. So, you see. Moreover, uh, there are budgetary savings to be made, I repeat, so it's fully funded. Furthermore, we have a program to ease economic burdens, with thirty billion in tax cuts for production, which will create wealth. We have a, uh, a reduction system for the corporate tax. Uh, as we raise the threshold, which is currently at thirty-eight thousand, up to three hundred thousand. It creates economic activity, it creates wealth.

VP: These are promises galore, and there's nothing.

EZ: Because you, you also make promises galore, you're right.

VP: In your program, the CSG [General Social Contribution] and the hospital won't be compensated. I'll tell you why; you need to announce the two hundred thousand job cuts. Because, if you don't announce it beforehand, you won't do it afterwards.

P1: Sometimes we plan ahead and still don't do it afterward.

EZ: Thank you, Mr. Bouleau.

VP: But Mr. Sarkozy, Nicolas Sarkozy, the last president who announced it, he did it.

P1: François Fillon promised three hundred and fifty thousand.

VP: He wasn't elected.

EZ: Emmanuel Macron promised a hundred and fifty thousand.

VP: I am not Emmanuel Macron.

EZ: You're the same.

VP: In my region, I promised ten percent job cuts. I did it. I saved two billion euros. Why am I talking about savings? Because you can say that the economy is secondary. But no, it's not secondary. A country's power comes from its economic strength.

P2: Nobody said it's secondary.

VP: And Eric Zemmour, with his program that's absolutely unfunded, has a program, just a program.

EZ: Just because you say anything doesn't mean you'll eventually make people believe it.

VP: François Fillon said that the state is bankrupt. It was ten years ago, and we have a thousand billion more in debt. We are at a breaking point. We need to make reforms, and Eric Zemmour said, we don't need reforms.
