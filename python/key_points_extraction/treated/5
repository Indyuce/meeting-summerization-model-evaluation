Pécresse accuses Macron of emptying the treasury, but now he's filling it up again with his proposal.
The government's program aims to ease economic burdens and create wealth through tax cuts and a reduction system for the corporate tax.
Zemmour supports raising the retirement age to 64 but doesn't provide any details on how he would fund his program.
Pecresse responds by pointing out that she has a track record of implementing reforms and saving money in her region, and that she is not just making empty promises.
Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour are debating on a current event related to Emmanuel Macron's proposal to raise the legal retirement age to 65.
The previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, did make job cuts, but the current president, Emmanuel Macron, has not.
The government needs to make reforms to address the country's economic challenges.
The candidate, Eric Zemmour, has promised to make reforms, but the text does not specify what those reforms are or how they will be funded.
Foreigners in France are eligible to receive the RSA (Réference Salariale Adaptée) after five years of residence, not immediately.
Zemmour concludes by saying that he will make reforms if elected, but that he will not make promises that he cannot keep.
Pecresse counters that these proposals are not enough and that Zemmour's program is unfunded.
Pécresse and Zemmour disagree on the amount of savings from cutting social benefits for non-European non-contributors, with Pécresse estimating it at 4 billion euros and Zemmour estimating it at 20 billion euros.
Zemmour also proposes to merge the territorial council, departmental council, and regional council to save money, which would result in savings of 20 billion euros.
Pécresse proposes to reform unemployment insurance, cut civil service jobs, and increase the minimum pension to net minimum wage.
The state is not bankrupt, despite what some politicians have claimed in the past, and France has a significant amount of debt.
