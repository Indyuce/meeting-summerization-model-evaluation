The perception that hard work and talent can take anyone from a lower socio-economic background to a higher one remains intact in America, but income inequality has been growing over the past 30 years.\n2. The rich have gotten richer while the middle class has stagnated or even decreased in income, with Venezuela and Nicaragua now having more equitable pay than the United States.\n3. The narrowing of the social ladder and the lack of faith in the fairness of life and the rules can corrode society.\n4. Timothy Noah debunks some of the long-accepted causes of income inequality in a 10-part series called \"The Great Divergence\" for Slate.com.\n5. There is no single cause of income inequality, but rather a combination of factors, including changes in tax regulations and economic policies that favor the rich.\n6. Gender and race are not major contributors to income inequality over the past 30 years, as they have actually narrowed the gap between these groups.\n7. The growing income inequality trend has been occurring since the Reagan administration.\n8. The program will also explore the growing love of food trucks.",

The rich have gotten richer while the middle class has stagnated or even declined, with Venezuela and Nicaragua having more equitable pay than the United States.\n3. Timothy Noah's 10-part series for Slate.com, \"The Great Divergence,\" debunks common causes of income inequality, such as gender and race, as the factors are not significant contributors to the growth in inequality over the past 30 years.\n4. Tax regulations have changed significantly over the past 30 years, with the top marginal rate dropping from 70% to 30%, but the effective tax rate has changed less than expected.\n5. Immigration has not been a significant factor in the growth of income inequality, with only a 7% depression in incomes for those without a high school degree.\n6. The decline of organized labor has had a tremendous impact on income inequality, with a decline in unionization in the private sector.\n7. The decline of manufacturing in the US has also contributed to income inequality, as it has led to a decline in the influence of labor unions.",

Effective tax rate: While the marginal tax rate has decreased, the effective tax rate (the amount of taxes actually paid) has also changed, but not as much as the marginal rate suggests.\n3. Immigration: Immigration has been cited as a potential cause of income inequality, but the impact on wages has been negligible for most people, with the exception of those who did not graduate high school.\n4. Decline of organized labor: The decline of organized labor in the private sector has had a significant impact on income inequality.\n5. Globalization: Globalization and trade with less-developed countries, particularly China, have contributed to income inequality.\n6. Benefits: The cost of employer-provided health insurance plans has been increasing and has become a bigger portion of workers' income, potentially explaining why wages have not kept up with productivity growth.\n7.

The author, Timothy Noah, argues that the growing disparity between people who graduated from college and those who did not is a major factor in the inequality trend.\n3. Noah also highlights the growing wealth of the very rich, whose incomes have increased significantly over the past few decades.\n4. The text mentions that the cost of health care benefits for workers has been increasing, which may also contribute to the stagnation of wages.\n5. The author notes that some employers have been shedding their health insurance obligations, which could further exacerbate the issue of income inequality.\n6. The text also includes a comment from a self-employed individual, Helena, who has not given her employee a cash raise in a couple of years but provides her with time off on a formula that gives her more time off each year.\n7. Helena notes that her business has been affected by the slowdown in the economy, and she has not seen an increase in her income despite the fact that productivity has increased in the past 10-15 years.\n8. The text concludes by acknowledging that there are two classes of people in society: the very rich and everyone else.",

The income disparity between the rich and the poor has been growing in the US for decades, with some periods seeing more significant growth than others.\n3. The causes of income inequality are complex and multifaceted, with factors such as technological advancements, globalization, and changes in government policies contributing to the issue.\n4. The effects of income inequality can be seen in the erosion of the American dream, where people feel that their children will not have the same opportunities as they did.\n5. Economist Jason Seligman argues that the idea that \"winning pays\" is a compelling motivator for people in society, but the likelihood of achieving this success over the course of a lifetime has changed over time.\n6. Income mobility is still alive and well in the US, with people moving up or down the income ladder based on factors such as pluck and luck.\n7. Expectations have changed over time, with people like Timothy Noah's mother experiencing different economic conditions throughout their lives.\n8. The cyclical nature of income disparities is a factor, with some periods seeing more significant growth than others.\n9. The solutions to income inequality are controversial and complex, with no easy answers.\n10. Economists and policymakers must work together to address the issue, considering a range of factors and potential solutions to ensure a more equitable distribution of income in the US.",

Upward mobility, or the ability to move up the social ladder, is no longer as easy as it used to be in the United States. Other countries, such as France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Canada, and Australia, have more upward mobility than the US.\n4. The difficulties of social mobility in the US are due to various factors, including the lack of opportunities for growth in the expansion, and the rewarding of unique, analytical, and critical-thinking skills in the workforce.\n5. Whitney, who runs a loss-control inspection business with her husband in Upstate New York, was able to give her employees raises by reducing expenses and becoming 100% virtual, allowing them to work from home and streamline their operations.\n6.
