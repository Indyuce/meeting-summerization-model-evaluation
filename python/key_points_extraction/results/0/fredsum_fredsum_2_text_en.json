Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour are debating on a current event related to Emmanuel Macron's proposal to raise the legal retirement age to 65.\n2. Pécresse accuses Zemmour of not making any substantial reforms and only proposing cuts related to immigration, which wouldn't be enough to cover deficits and implement fundamental reforms.\n3. Zemmour responds by saying that he has been proposing to raise the retirement age to 64, which would save approximately 20 billion euros.\n4. Pécresse acknowledges that there are sectors where hiring needs to be assessed, such as the justice system and healthcare, but Zemmour argues that cuts need to be made in a systematic and methodical way.\n5. Zemmour also proposes to merge the territorial council, departmental council, and regional council to save money, which would result in savings of 20 billion euros.\n6. Pécresse and Zemmour disagree on the amount of savings from cutting social benefits for non-European non-contributors, with Pécresse estimating it at 4 billion euros and Zemmour estimating it at 20 billion euros.",

Zemmour responds by pointing out that he has proposed specific reforms, such as raising the retirement age and cutting social benefits for non-European non-contributors, which could save twenty billion euros.\n3. Pecresse counters that these proposals are not enough and that Zemmour's program is unfunded.\n4. Zemmour acknowledges that his program may not include all the details that Pecresse would like, but argues that he has a systematic method for assessing the needs of different sectors and making cuts where necessary.\n5. Pecresse expresses frustration that Zemmour has not announced specific job cuts in his program, despite promising to do so.\n6. Zemmour defends his program by pointing out that he has a track record of implementing reforms in the past and that he has proposed a reduction system for the corporate tax.\n7. Pecresse argues that the economy is not just about cutting costs, but also about creating wealth and jobs.\n8. Zemmour acknowledges that he has not been elected president, but argues that his program is more realistic and feasible than some of the promises made by other candidates.\n9. Pecresse responds by pointing out that she has a track record of implementing reforms and saving money in her region, and that she is not just making empty promises.\n10. Zemmour concludes by saying that he will make reforms if elected, but that he will not make promises that he cannot keep.",
