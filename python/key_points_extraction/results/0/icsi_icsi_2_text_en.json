The speaker mentions that they will try to connect with Hynek and other people as much as possible on Wednesday.\n5.

Barry wants to know what an acoustic event is, and the speaker explains that it is something that occurs in the acoustic signal that is easy to measure and is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere.\n3. The speaker gives an example of 20 acoustic events, including frication and nasality.\n4. Barry asks for an example of a paper that discusses phoneme recognition using acoustic events, and the speaker mentions a paper by Hubener and Cardson (Benson Bernds).\n5. Barry and the speaker discuss the difference between acoustic features and acoustic events, with Barry explaining that acoustic features are things that linguists talk about, such as the height and tenseness of a phone, while acoustic events are something that occurs in the acoustic signal that is easy to measure.\n6. The speaker agrees with Barry's explanation and adds that acoustic events are a little different from acoustic features in that they are something that occurs in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure.\n7. Barry mentions that there are other things beyond what they talked about that aren't just rapid changes in the acoustic signal, but the speaker is not sure what those things are.\n8. Barry and the speaker discuss the difference between top-down and bottom-up approaches to phonetic feature extraction, with Barry explaining that top-down approaches look at the phone and say what features it should have, while bottom-up approaches look at the acoustic signal and see if the features are there.",

The speaker is discussing the difference between acoustic features and acoustic events in the context of speech recognition.\n2. Acoustic features are defined as things that linguists talk about, such as the height, tenseness, and laxness of a phone. These features may or may not be easy to measure in the acoustic signal.\n3. Acoustic events, on the other hand, are defined as something that occurs in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure.\n4. The speaker uses the analogy of top-down and bottom-up processing to explain the difference between acoustic features and events. Top-down processing involves looking at the phone and saying what features it should have, while bottom-up processing involves looking at the acoustic signal and identifying events that may have occurred.\n5. The speaker mentions that they are working on developing event detectors that can be used to perform cheating experiments in speech recognition.\n6. The speaker also mentions that they want to modify the structure of these models in a data-driven way, similar to the way that Jeff Bilmes did his work.\n7. The speaker mentions that they can measure their progress by comparing the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like neural nets.\n8. The speaker mentions that once they have these event detectors, they can feed the outputs of the event detectors into the SRI HMM system and test it on Switchboard or Aurora data.",

The conversation also touches on the topic of the speakers' progress in measuring their progress in developing the event detectors, and how they will be testing their outputs on speech recognition systems.\n6. The speaker mentions that there are a few other people who will be visiting for six months, including Professor Kollmeier and Michael Kleinschmidt.\n7. The speaker mentions that they are interested in exploring different ways of looking at spectra in order to extract various speech properties.\n8.
