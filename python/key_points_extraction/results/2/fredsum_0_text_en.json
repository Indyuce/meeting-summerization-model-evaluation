Sarkozy proposes that over the next five years, the incoming migratory flow should be reduced by half, from 180,000 to 80,000, by introducing a single judge for immigration law, requiring French language examination for all newcomers, and preventing people from coming to France just for the attraction of certain social benefits.\n4. Hollande proposes that the current annual migratory flow is 180,000, and that the problem is that France has welcomed too many people, which has paralyzed its integration system.\n5. Sarkozy suggests that the problem is that France has become an open country, and it needs to reduce the number of immigrants it welcomes.\n6.
