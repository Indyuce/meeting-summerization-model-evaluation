The meeting agenda is limited to reading digits.\n3. F is unsure about the agenda for next week.\n4. F suggests adjusting the scaling and insertion penalty in the sorting algorithm.\n5. Adjusting the scaling and insertion penalty in the sorting algorithm did not make a significant difference in the well-matched case.\n6. More experimentation is needed to determine the best way to adjust the scaling and insertion penalty.\n7. The conclusion is that applying the same number of states to all languages is not bad, even if it sounds \"pretty dumb.\"\n8. The next question to ask is how much better the system would perform in noise if it were adjusted.\n9. The front-end of the system, which is the Aurora-two version, will be tested with default insertion penalties and then tweaked to see how much of a difference it makes.\n10. Adjusting the scaling and insertion penalty in the sorting algorithm is an interesting idea that should be explored further.",
