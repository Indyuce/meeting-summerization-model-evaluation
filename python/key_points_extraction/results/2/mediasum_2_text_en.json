Piracy, murder, exploitation, sea slavery, gun running, and intentional dumping are widespread and diverse criminal activities that occur beyond the reach of law and order off the shore.\n3. Investigative reporter Ian Urbina continued reporting after his 2015 multi-part series for The New York Times.\n4. The criminal activities off the shore are so extensive and diverse that Urbino's new book, \"The Outlaw Ocean,\" contains his reporting.\n5. The ocean is a vital part of the planet, both in terms of its use as a means of transportation and its role in providing food and oxygen.\n6. The global fishing industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, but it is often plagued by hidden costs, including illegal activities such as slavery and the capture of protected fish.\n7. The ocean is not in good health, with illegal dumping turning it into a trash can and causing environmental damage.\n8. There are isolated, achievable things that can be done to improve the health of the ocean, including instigating more political will from governments and pressuring companies to clean up their supply chains.\n9. Working on this book and previous reporting has changed Urbino's habits, including his decision to not eat seafood or meat.\n10. The book \"The Outlaw Ocean\" by Ian Urbina is a comprehensive look at the criminal activities that occur off the shore.",
