The decision to be made includes the type of energy used, chip on print, and the kind of case.\n5. The meeting will also consider the user interface concept, including the type of interface and any supplements.\n6. The meeting will be concluded with a trend watching presentation by Sammy on his work.\n7. Rama will present the first component.\n8. The components to be designed include energy, material, and interface.\n9. Energy options include simple battery, traditional solar cells, or a combination of both.\n10. Materials for the energy component include plastic, rubber, and titanium.\n11. The interface will use push buttons or liquid crystal display (LCD) with moving type of thing.\n12. A speech recognition chip will be included in the remote control.\n13. The chip will use microphone sensors and be programmable.\n14. The remote control will be examined for any improvements.",

The speaker is discussing the possibility of creating a remote control with fancy features, such as a titanium or spongy body, and whether to use rubber or a different material.\n2.

The speaker mentions that they will explore the possibility of making the remote control with two different assembly options, such as a spongy and a titanium body.\n4. They will also consider whether rubber is expensive and whether they should choose titanium or spongy.\n5. The speaker mentions that they have a large department of paint and can paint the remote control after it is designed.\n6. The speaker also mentions that they want to keep the L_C_D_ (left, center, right) layout of the remote control, and that they will stick with two batteries and not use solar power or anything else that is not classical.\n7. The speaker concludes that people change their TVs more often than they change the batteries in their remote control, and that the trend goes faster than the life of the remote control.",
