The group is discussing the possibility of recording meetings in a different location, such as a radio studio, rather than in a traditional meeting room.\n2. They are considering the idea of asking people to record their meetings in a distant microphone, rather than using a traditional meeting setup.\n3. Some members of the group are skeptical about the idea, citing concerns about the quality of the recordings and the difficulty of getting people to participate.\n4. Others are more optimistic, suggesting that they could potentially find interested parties who would be willing to record meetings in a radio studio.\n5. The group mentions that they have already recorded some meetings in the past, but these recordings are not easily accessible to the general public.\n6. They also mention that they have contacted people at the Haas Business School who are interested in speech recognition, but these individuals have expressed no interest in holding meetings in a radio studio.\n7. The group discusses the potential benefits of recording meetings in a radio studio, including the ability to get more lively discussions and the possibility of finding interested parties who would be willing to participate.\n8. They also mention that they could potentially find out more information about how radio stations record their shows and use this knowledge to improve their own recordings.\n9. Some members of the group express doubts about the feasibility of the idea, citing concerns about the difficulty of getting people to participate and the potential lack of quality in the recordings.\n10. Others are more optimistic and suggest that they could potentially find interested parties who would be willing to participate, despite the challenges.",

For example:\nG: \"Let's wrap up the meeting soon.\"\nE: \"Okay, that's a good idea.\"\nC: \"Yes, let's end the meeting on a productive note.\"\nG: \"Okay, I'll turn off the microphone in a moment.\"\nB: \"Good to know.\"\nE: \"I'm glad we could have this meeting and discuss important topics.\"\nBy using respectful language and avoiding harmful terms, we can create a more inclusive and positive environment for everyone.",
