They are considering a variety of movies, including \"Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"Chucky,\" \"Game of Thrones,\" \"Spirited Away,\" \"Howl's Moving Castle,\" and \"Grave of the Fireflies.\"\n3. Some members of the group are hesitant to include certain movies, such as \"Chucky,\" as they are not fantasy movies.\n4. They suggest including \"Spirited Away\" and \"Ghibli films\" as they are fantasy and can introduce a different culture.\n5.

The group discusses the idea of combining their four themes into one movie, but finds it challenging.\n7. They mention a series they had found but cannot come up with a single theme.\n8. One member suggests \"Night of the Living Dead\" but notes that they already have a horror movie.\n9. Another member suggests \"Scary Movie\" as a divine spark, which is met with approval from the rest of the group.",
