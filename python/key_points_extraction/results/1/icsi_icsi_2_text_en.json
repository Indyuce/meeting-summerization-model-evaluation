The speaker is discussing the idea of vocal tract normalization, which is a technique used in speech processing to account for the variations in the human vocal tract during speech production.\n2. The speaker mentions that they had thought about using a similar approach to what they do in vocal tract length normalization, but they had not thought about it too much.\n3. The speaker suggests that one could use a general speech model, such as a mixture of Gaussians, to evaluate each utterance against and determine the likelihood of each utterance.\n4. The speaker notes that this approach would require dividing the range of likelihoods into discrete bins and adjusting the statistical engine accordingly.\n5. The speaker expresses skepticism about the feasibility of implementing this approach in real-time with less than two hundred milliseconds latency, as it would require processing each frame of speech individually.\n6. The speaker suggests that it could be expensive to implement this approach and that it would be difficult to do it on a per-frame basis.\n7. The speaker mentions that BBN (Bellcore) did a thing with vocal tract normalization a ways back, but they are not sure if other people did as well.\n8. The speaker notes that identifying the third formant using the average third formant as an indicator of vocal tract length is one way to account for the variations in the human vocal tract during speech production.\n9. The speaker explains that the first formant moves out by some proportion when the vocal tract is changed, and that the third formant moves out by a different proportion.\n10. The speaker provides an example of how the formants would move if the vocal tract were shorter by 50%, with the first formant moving from 100 Hz to 750 Hz and the third formant moving from 2500 Hz to 3750 Hz.",
