The company is discussing the design of a new remote control for their TVs, and they are considering adding a feature to display menus on the TV screen.\n2. They are unsure if they can do this without having some kind of input or control over the TV itself.\n3. They mention that if they produce the TVs, they can put menus on the screen, but they need something to superimpose the menus on the video signal.\n4. They discuss the cost of adding this feature and whether it would be feasible to do it with a basic remote control.\n5. They mention that they want to focus on their own line of TVs, but they also want to make sure the remote control can work with other companies' TVs.\n6. They discuss the possibility of using automatic speech recognition to display the menu options, but they are unsure if this is possible or practical.\n7. They mention that most TVs nowadays have teletext, which they want to use instead of the remote control for displaying menus.\n8. They want to move away from using teletext and instead use the internet for displaying menus.\n9. They are unsure if it is possible to increase the unit price of the remote control to make it more fancy and add more value.\n10. They discuss the goal of putting an LCD in the remote control and what kind of information could be displayed on it.",

The team is discussing the possibility of using automatic speech recognition technology in the remote control.\n5. The team is unsure what information they could display on the remote control, but they mention that they could show the name of the programme, the start time, and even a small image of the main actors.\n6. The team is considering using electronic programme guides (EPGs) for information, but they are not sure if they will have pictures.\n7. The team mentions that they cannot provide information that is not available from teletext or the internet.\n8.

The speakers are discussing the possibility of creating a new remote control for TVs that would have a built-in LCD screen and speech recognition technology.\n2.

The speakers are unsure if this information is available through teletext, but there are electronic programme guides (EPGs) available that provide similar information.\n4. The EPGs may not have pictures, but they may have other information such as the start time and name of the program.\n5. The speakers are considering targeting the replacement remote market, as people may want to buy a new remote when their current one breaks.\n6. The cost of the LCD screen and speech recognition technology could be high, and the speakers are unsure if it is worth the cost.\n7. The speakers are open to discussing the LCD screen and speech recognition technology, but they do not want to use speech recognition technology in the remote control.\n8.
