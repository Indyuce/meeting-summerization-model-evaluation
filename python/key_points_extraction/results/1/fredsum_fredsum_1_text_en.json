The speaker mentions that 200,000 women will be forced to work until they are 64 years old, and 20% of women in the country will have to wait until they are 67 years old to receive full retirement benefits.\n3. The speaker questions whether it is acceptable to have a nurse giving injections to someone at the age of 67, or teaching assistants with children in that age group.\n4. The speaker mentions that some people may not have complete careers due to the law passed in 2003.\n5. The speaker expresses concern that the law will affect feminist achievements in the country, specifically for people in the private sector who will have to take only 2 years of parental leave for each child, rather than the previous 4 years.\n6. The speaker suggests that there may be some articles in the 20 that could be voted on in favor of parental leave, but the overall impact of the law on women's retirement and careers is a concern.\n7. The speaker mentions that 3000 women and 900,000 women will be affected by the law.",

The Minister of Public Finance (MP) questions the Official Representative of the Government (OV) about the reduction in maternity quarters and the impact on women's pensions.\n3. The Official Representative of the Government (OV) clarifies that the 8 quarters per child remain unchanged and that the reform aims to provide more years of contributions for women who take care of children or relatives.\n4. The Minister of Public Finance (MP) expresses skepticism about the reform, citing the potential impact on women's careers and pensions.\n5. The Official Representative of the Government (OV) explains that the reform is not intended to take away maternity quarters but rather to provide more time for caregiver leave, which is not currently counted towards pension eligibility.\n6. The Minister of Public Finance (MP) remains unconvinced and expresses concern about the impact on women's pensions, particularly those who may need to work longer due to the increased legal retirement age.\n7. The Official Representative of the Government (OV) reiterates that the reform aims to provide more years of contributions for women who take care of children or relatives, but acknowledges that the reform may have unintended consequences.\n8.

The caregiver leave, which allows someone to take care of a child or relative, is now being counted as time worked, rather than wasted time.\n3. The Minister is not forcing anyone to work an additional 2 years, but rather, the legal retirement age is being raised from 62 to 64.\n4. The Minister is not taking away maternity quarters from women, but rather, the law is being drafted to consider maternity leaves differently.\n5. The Minister is being criticized for forcing women to work the same amount of time as they get during maternity leave.\n6. Jordan Bardella is quoting Emmanuel Macron, who said that it's difficult for people in certain regions and with certain career paths to reach the new retirement age of 64.\n7. The Minister is responding to this by saying that there are more job openings than unemployed people in certain departments, and that there are sociologists who have studied this issue.\n8. The MP is arguing that the Minister is not doing enough to address the issue of unemployment and is instead focusing on raising the retirement age.",

Hadrien Clouet, a sociologist and LFI deputy, has worked on the issue of unemployment and has found that there are more job openings than unemployed people in certain departments.\n6. The proposal to raise the retirement age is expected to create a \"factory for welfare\" and a \"poverty trap.\"\n7. The president of the French Mutualité Federation has expressed concerns that the reform would cost 10 billion euros in disability and inability to work, and would lead to 110,000 people being socioeconomically affected, including those receiving RSA, specific solidarity allowance, or adult disability allowance.\n8.

The speaker cites three key elements of the reform that address these concerns:\na. The disability mechanism will remain unchanged, providing 3 billion euros in support.\nb. The age of 67 will not be changed, avoiding the \"poverty traps\" created by the 2010 reform.\nc. The transition to the new retirement age will be gradual, with a 3-month increase per year, allowing for greater adaptation.\n4. The speaker acknowledges that the head of the mutual society has made predictions about the impact of the reform on unemployment and the macroeconomic impact on the country, but argues that these predictions are based on the 2010 retirement reform and not the current proposal.\n5.
