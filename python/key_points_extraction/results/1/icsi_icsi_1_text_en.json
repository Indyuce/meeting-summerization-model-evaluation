The team member, A, mentions that the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data is interesting, but they are not sure if it would be better to use multiple nets or a single net with different parameters.",

The team leader explains that the labels are not accurate, and they are not sure if it's a bug or something wrong in their approach.\n5. The speaker suggests that hand-labeled data is the best approach.\n6. The team leader agrees and mentions that they don't know if they can get hand-labeled data from other languages.\n7. The speaker mentions that it would be interesting to see if combining multiple nets would be better.\n8. The team leader mentions that they don't know for sure if it would be helpful to have different nets, and they raise a question about reverberation.\n9. The team leader mentions that they won't meet next week because the speaker will be in Europe.\n10. The speaker mentions that they will be back on Tuesday, and the team leader agrees.\n111. The team leader mentions that the main topic for the next meeting will be the speaker sharing their experiences.\n12. The team leader jokingly suggests that they should say \"real nasty things\" after the meeting.\n13. The speaker suggests doing \"digits\" (a common term in machine learning) first.",
