Timothy Noah's 10-part series for Slate.com, \"The Great Divergence,\" debunks long-accepted causes of income inequality, such as gender and race, as the primary factors contributing to the trend.\n4. Tax regulations have changed significantly over the past 30 years, with the top marginal rate dropping from 70% to 30%, contributing to the growth in income inequality.\n5. The narrowing of the social ladder and the erosion of faith in the fairness of the system can have corrosive effects on society.\n6.

Tax regulations, particularly the drop in top marginal rates under the Reagan administration, have been a surprising contributing factor to income inequality.\n4.

The effective tax rate, which is the amount of taxes actually paid by individuals, has changed more than the marginal tax rate, which is the change in tax rates.\n2. Immigration has not been a significant factor in the growing income gap, according to economists. While immigrants at the bottom of the education spectrum have seen their incomes depressed by 7%, there has been little impact on the incomes of those with higher levels of education.\n3. The decline of organized labor has had a tremendous impact on income inequality, particularly in the private sector.\n4. The decline of manufacturing in the US has also contributed to income inequality, as it has led to the decline of labor unions and the loss of jobs.\n5. Trade, particularly with less-developed countries like China, has had an impact on income inequality in the US. China's low wages and importation of US goods have likely contributed to inequality.\n6. The host discusses the growing income gap with Timothy Noah, a columnist at Slate.com, who is writing a series on the topic.\n7.

While many economists initially concluded that foreign trade was not contributing to income inequality in the 1990s, Paul Krugman later argued that the situation had changed by the 2000s due to the rapid growth of US trade with less-developed countries, particularly China.\n4. The value of employer-provided health insurance plans has been increasing drastically year after year, and this has been adding to the growing income disparity.\n5. Some people have suggested that the slow increase in productivity during the last 10-15 years may be due to the fact that the cost of health care benefits has been taking a larger portion of workers' income, which has had a depressing effect on wages.\n6.

The speaker notes that the last time there was a significant economic correction was in the early 1980s, and in their area, 40% of the construction industry went away and never came back.\n4. The speaker highlights the risk-taking nature of the construction industry, where people speculate in housing and the self-employed do not receive unemployment benefits or other government support during economic downturns.\n5. The speaker mentions that the cost of health insurance has been going up, and companies have been shedding their health insurance obligations, which is one of the arguments President Obama marshaled in pushing for healthcare reform.\n6. The speaker notes that there are two trends involved in the growing disparity between people who graduated from college and people who didn't: one involving educational opportunities and the other involving the very rich whose incomes have taken off like a rocket.\n7. The speaker is discussing the topic of income inequality with Timothy Noah, a columnist at Slate.com, who wrote a 10-part series on the subject.\n8.

The income disparity between the rich and the poor in the United States is a controversial issue, with some people believing it is due to factors such as hard work and playing by the rules, while others believe it is due to systemic issues such as inequality and discrimination.\n2. Economist Jason Seligman studies these issues and argues that the facts are not controversial, and that income tax data from the IRS or other sources can be used to document the disparity in income.\n3. The effect of income inequality on people's beliefs and motivation is a complex issue, with some people feeling motivated by the idea of winning and getting ahead, while others feel disillusioned and demotivated by the lack of opportunity for advancement.\n4. Seligman argues that the idea of \"pluck and luck\" plays a significant role in income mobility, with some people moving up the economic ladder through their own efforts and luck, while others are held back by a lack of opportunities and resources.\n5. Expectations and perceptions of the economy and society also play a role in shaping people's beliefs and motivations, with events such as economic crises and political changes affecting people's attitudes towards work and opportunity.\n6. Seligman believes that income inequality is a complex issue with many factors at play, including systemic issues such as inequality and discrimination, as well as individual factors such as hard work and luck.\n7. He argues that understanding the facts and the underlying causes of income inequality is essential for developing effective solutions to address the issue.",

Difficulty with social mobility in the US: The text discusses how the US has traditionally been known for its upward mobility, but it is no longer the undisputed champion. The author interviews bosses about the last time they gave their employees a raise, revealing that many have not given raises in recent years.\n3. Factors affecting social mobility: The text identifies two main factors that are affecting social mobility in the US: the lack of opportunity for growth and the rewarding of certain skills and education in the workforce.\n4. Educational system: The text suggests that the US educational system is a major factor in the lack of social mobility, as it is not providing the necessary skills and education for workers to compete in the global economy.\n5. Small businesses and raises: The text highlights an example of a small business in Upstate New York that was able to give its employees raises by reducing expenses and becoming 100% virtual. This shows that even small businesses can find ways to reward their employees despite the economic challenges.\n6. Importance of retaining staff: The text emphasizes the importance of retaining staff by providing raises and cross-training employees to reduce the risk of losing them to competitors.\n7. Streamlining and flexibility: The text notes that the business was able to streamline its operations and become more flexible by getting rid of hard assets and allowing employees to work from home.
