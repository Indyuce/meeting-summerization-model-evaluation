Seafood is also a source of protein for much of the planet.\n* The global fishing industry is often perceived as being able to fish sustainably and legally, but this is not the reality. Hidden costs, such as illegal activities and inhumane treatment of workers, are often used to save money and deliver products to consumers at a lower cost.\n* Urbina's book highlights these hidden costs, including the use of captive labor and illegal fishing practices.\n* The ocean is also a crucial part of the planet in terms of climate change, as it acts as a temperature stabilizer.",
