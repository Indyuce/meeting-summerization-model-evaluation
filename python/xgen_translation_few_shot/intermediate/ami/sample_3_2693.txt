### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.

<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ME> Is this okay?
<ID> Uh yeah.
<ID> Fine now.
<ID> Oh, it's not liking us, it went that-a-way.
<ID> Computer adjusting.
<ID> Oh.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So.
<ID> Right.
<ID> You ready back there?
<ID> Uh okay.
<ID> Welcome everyone.
<ID> Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day.
<ID> Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction.
<ID> As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting, um become acquainted with each other, um have a little training on tools, uh create a plan, discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> The new remote control is to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> That, Steph, is your part, is the user-friendliness.
<ID> The originality um is gonna take all of us.
<ID> Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you, Sarah.
<ID> Um and we'll get on with it.
<ID> Okay, so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design.
<ID> Okay?
<ID> Right.
<ID> Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard.
<ID> Kate, why don't you try it first, if you can either bring your things with you, I guess And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well, 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around.
<PM> Uh yeah, if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces, hang on.
<PM> Uh right, so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal.
<PM> Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is?
<ID> Uh I do not think so, I think it's just to try out the whiteboard.
<PM> Um Only animal I could thin I could draw.
<UI> Are we all gonna draw a cat?
<ME> I know.
<ID> Ah.
<PM> Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat.
<PM> You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears.
<ID> Uh-huh.
<PM> Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well, sort of Right, yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Great.
<ID> And the characteristics?
<PM> Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think, um because they're the easiest to draw.
<ID> Uh-huh.
<PM> In fact, I'll give it some more Oh, and the tail Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Fantastic.
<ID> Since you're handy as well, why don't you do yours next, Steph.
<ID> I think it's to get us used to using the pen.
<PM> Um sure it's not to test our artistic It's a mouse.
<ID> Uh no.
<ID> A mouse-y?
<UI> That's not a mouse-y, no.
<PM> No it's not a mouse.
<PM> It's a wombat.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> It's a ratty.
<ID> Argh.
<PM> A what?
<UI> A ratty.
<ID> Rat.
<ID> Not a mouse, a rat.
<PM> A webbed foot.
<PM> Webbed f Oh right.
<UI> It's clothes.
<UI> That's it's clothes.
<UI> It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail.
<ID> And your favourite characteristics of that animal.
<UI> I love whiskers.
<UI> Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and uh fantastic pets and very friendly.
<ID> Oh.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework.
<ID> Kate?
<ME> Thanks.
<ID> Oh, a fish.
<UI> A shark?
<PM> Gosh, why didn't I think of fish?
<PM> That's even easier to draw than cat.
<ME> Mm this is very representational fish.
<ID> Oh, okay.
<ID> Fine.
<ME> Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups, so.
<ID> Favourite characteristics?
<ID> 'Kay.
<ID> So they have team elements.
<ME> Do you have a favourite one?
<ID> I'm afraid I'm with Steph.
<ID> And I think your pen's running out of whatever.
<ID> But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out, and the cat's looking the other way.
<ID> He's hiding.
<ID> Um cats are sometimes very independent.
<ID> My parents had cats.
<ID> Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros, with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros.
<ID> That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale.
<ID> Um would be an awful lot of these, would be like what, a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million.
<ID> Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item.
<ID> Now if they cost twelve and a half, you're selling it for twenty five, you're making twelve and a half Euros each.
<ID> Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million, that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling?
<ME> Uh yeah.
<ME> I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal B yeah.
<ID> Mark-up?
<ME> Um I would think would be more like sixty percent.
<ME> But um let me I have two thoughts.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> One hundred, fifty percent.
<ME> And and your question is how many do we have to sell?
<ID> Yes, 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know, you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that.
<ME> At twenty five.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah, that's um So that's four million of them?
<ID> To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking.
<ID> Something like that?
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> That's fifty million Euros.
<ID> In order to make fifty million Euros, and you're only getting twelve and a half each That's a lot of selling.
<ME> And if we make Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Two four To be fifty, be four million.
<ME> Four million.
<ID> You'd have to sell four million.
<ME> Hmm.
<ID> Okay?
<ID> Right.
<ID> Experience with a remote control.
<ID> Any of you use of remote control for a television or DVD or something?
<PM> That that that's the sorta product we're talking about, one that will work for a in a home environment, for a TVs and I think one that works would be good.
<ID> You're both nodding, all three.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time, but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another.
<UI> It is true that you always sit around you know, you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something, there's five different remotes, and one for the DVD and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Y yeah.
<ID> And they don't always talk to each other.
<UI> But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television.
<ID> Don't know.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Are there any um ideas for the remote?
<ID> What would it be for and what group would be be for?
<ID> We have to think about that one.
<ME> We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote.
<UI> I think one in b bright colours would be good.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation.
<ME> Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products.
<ME> Electrical their industrial design is very good.
<UI> I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions.
<UI> Like I've got one at home that has well, apart from the obvious, channels, channel up, channel down, volume, you know, subtitles, mute, there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do, like.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Well, that's a really good point, because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to um go to menus and then make choices, you know, so if it's like an uh volume button, you know, you can go in and say mute or or volume.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down.
<UI> Mm.
<ID> Mm.
<ME> Mm.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> We can make it smart like an iPod, you know, make everything menus.
<UI> Ooh, closing the meeting.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Um I know this sounds like it was very quick, but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one, that's Kate, for the working design.
<UI> That was quick.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And user, that's you S Steph, for the technical functions design, and for marketing the user requirements specification.
<ID> I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group, and I think we all, you know, we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish, but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done.
<ID> Uh as it says, we're gonna get individual instructions, but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time, so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead.
<ID> Do you all agree?
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Alright.
<ID> Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things.
<ID> Alright, so this is the end of the first meeting.
<ME> Okay.
<PM> 'Kay.
<ID> Thank you all.
