<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.

<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.

<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.

<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> Okay.
<ID> Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing.
<ID> Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager.
<ID> And I know all your names again, Courtney, Fenella and Amber.
<ME> Yep.
<PM> Yep.
<ID> Alright.
<ID> Okay, so first let's go through this PowerPoint.
<ID> I wonder what button I press?
<UI> Just do it on the arrow.
<ID> Yeah, or how about I just click?
<ID> Okay, here is our agenda for this meeting.
<ID> Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions.
<ID> We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better.
<ID> Um tool training, we're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles.
<ID> Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting.
<ID> Okay, here is our project.
<ID> We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original, trendy and also user-friendly.
<ID> And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first, how is it gonna be used, what's the actual goal here, it has to operate TV, blah blah blah.
<ID> And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet.
<ID> Same thing with conceptual design.
<ID> Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work, meet.
<ID> That's pretty much the the whole process for today.
<ID> And then the detailed design, just more in-depth, get the actual schematics of the remote.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Alright.
<ID> First we're gonna start off by using our tools.
<ID> And the whiteboard thing, do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here.
<PM> I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing.
<ME> We could Yeah, we could on here.
<ID> Alright, let's go forward then.
<ID> Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal.
<ID> Even if you are not a good drawer like me.
<ID> Alright.
<PM> Artistic skills, nil.
<UI> Fine.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Bless you.
<ME> Oh, thanks.
<PM> I draw like I'm in grade five.
<ID> Oh do I.
<ID> 'Kay, about one more minute.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And who would like to start us off?
<ME> I'll go.
<ID> Alright.
<ME> Um this is my picture.
<ME> I drew fish I like fish, because uh, you know, their whole water-vascular system thing.
<ME> It's pretty cool, and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes, sometimes vicious but that's okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Only if they're piranhas.
<ME> Yeah, they they're easy, you know.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Alright.
<ID> Who wants to go next?
<PM> I'll go.
<PM> I drew a kitty.
<PM> It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat, but I love cats.
<ME> No I I see it.
<UI> No, I kne I knew.
<ID> No, it looks like a cat.
<ME> Yeah, it does look like a cat.
<PM> I love cats because they're independent, uh they pretty much know what they want, they get it, they move on.
<ID> I love cats, too.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> I'm a cat person.
<ME> I'm allergic to cats.
<UI> Ah.
<ID> Uh.
<PM> I'm allergic to cats, too.
<ME> Oh, okay.
<ID> If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic, but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it, you know, it's weird.
<UI> In my next life.
<ME> Yeah, yeah, if you're around them for a long period of time Oh, yeah, this summer I, oh I had to live with cats.
<PM> I still can't sleep with them in my room.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> It was crazy.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay, Fenella?
<UI> Um, I drew a badger.
<ME> Cool.
<PM> Yay.
<ID> Badger.
<UI> Well, yeah.
<ID> Good choice.
<ID> Why a badger?
<UI> Uh I dunno, they're grumpy and nocturnal and Well, a little bit like the Yes.
<PM> Are you trying to suggest something?
<UI> Um.
<UI> And then, if you know Wind in the Willows badger.
<ME> Oh, okay.
<UI> Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian.
<UI> He's Liverpudlian writer.
<ID> Alright.
<UI> Um, that kind of books.
<UI> Badgers are cool in that one too.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And I'm last.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ID> Look at my sad sad giraffe.
<ME> No, that's good.
<ID> No, no, no, it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur, but whatever.
<ID> I don't know even much about giraffes, but I just love the way they look.
<ID> They're just such odd creatures, you know.
<ID> I I like that they're so unique and individual, I guess.
<ID> I don't know much about their behaviour or anything, though.
<ID> Only seen a couple in zoos.
<ME> You don't really have to, I mean, if you like 'em Right.
<ID> Yeah, but you can appreciate the way they look.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Alright.
<ID> Guess we're getting straight back into business here.
<ID> Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro, and our profit aim is fifty million Euro.
<ID> We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States, in Europe, in Asia.
<ID> And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So we're gonna talk for a little while.
<ID> Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss.
<ID> Expe our experiences with remote controls um, our first ideas about this new remote, anything that you can bring to the table for this project.
<ID> So.
<UI> Now?
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> You wanna start us off?
<ID> Anybody have anything to offer?
<PM> Well, we wanna make a multifunctional remote, right?
<ID> Right.
<PM> One remote for everything.
<UI> And everything being Wait, we have what, sound system, TV, DVD, VHS, uh TiVo?
<PM> Um.
<PM> I think they'll be phasing VHS out shortly.
<ME> Yeah, TiVo.
<ID> TiVo.
<UI> But it's still there, so if po if we're gonna do it Or if it's not like a Sony, if it's like a I don't know.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal.
<ID> They're never universal.
<ID> That's right.
<ID> Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product, DVD player, say, usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Something from Sam's club.
<PM> So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet, because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay, and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product, how it feels in your hand.
<ID> If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more.
<ID> They want the ergonomic ones.
<ME> They want like the flashy lights.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> Oh like this came from Las Vegas.
<ID> Ones that ones that look high-tech, too.
<UI> But at the same time are simple.
<ME> Mm yeah.
<ID> Right.
<ID> So that people like my mother can use it.
<PM> What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand?
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ID> Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that Yeah.
<UI> Just bad ones.
<ID> That's true.
<UI> Um.
<PM> What kinda battery would we want to use?
<PM> Because battery changing is usually Okay.
<UI> D Double A.
<ME> Double A.
<ID> Do some of them use triple As though?
<ME> Yeah some use triple As.
<UI> Some but Yeah, I guess then it's If we need to do triple A we can, but most people usually have double As around.
<ME> So double or triple?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> But that has to do with the size of it too.
<UI> Right.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Well, w as long as we know that issue is Here we can Triple A.
<ME> Yeah, if we want it to be more thin, then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A.
<PM> Can you with a small lithium battery?
<ID> But it's okay, we don't have to decide about it now, just as long as we remember battery type and size is important.
<ID> Hey.
<ID> Anything else?
<ID> Alright.
<ID> Moving along.
<ID> Oh, we're closing the meeting.
<ID> Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes.
<ID> Here's what we're going to do.
<ID> Um the ID, which is who?
<ID> Okay, you're going to think about the working design.
<ID> What do you think that means?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And UID, the technical fun functions design, making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do, the functionality of it, operating all those different things.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And the marketing person, that's Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification.
<ID> I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for.
<ID> Right?
<ME> Right.
<ID> I would think so.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while.
<ID> Okay, so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This meeting is officially over.
