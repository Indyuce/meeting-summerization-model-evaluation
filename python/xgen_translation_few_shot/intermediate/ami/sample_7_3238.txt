### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.

<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> Now uh blank?
<ID> Blank, yes.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> No problem.
<UI> Shit happens.
<ME> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> A parrot.
<ME> Wow.
<UI> Ish.
<ME> Oh.
<UI> He did it before.
<PM> Uh No, no.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Nice.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> Okay.
<ID> Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype.
<ID> It really looks like a banana.
<UI> It is a banana.
<ID> It is a banana.
<UI> It is the essence of bananas.
<UI> I would be confused with this thing.
<ID> Mm.
<UI> S How is everyone?
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Hi.
<PM> Hi.
<ID> So we are here for the detailed design meeting.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting.
<ID> Then uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual.
<ID> We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work.
<ID> And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product.
<ID> Then we will uh evaluate the product.
<ID> And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time, that is to say uh to have a standard battery, to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy, and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera.
<UI> Like a banana.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros.
<ID> So which is uh good, because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So for the financial aspect it's okay, we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if, and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> You have a presentation?
<ID> Participant four, yes.
<ME> Evaluation.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> So you can go.
<ME> We can go through.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings.
<ME> So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> We we talked about before.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, and robust, uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> So I go through all the uh all the points here, and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point, two point or seven point.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> Okay?
<ID> Okay.
<ME> And after we ha we have an an average, and uh we see.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> The okay?
<ME> Uh so uh fancy look and feel, what do you think?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Maybe you can presen okay.
<ME> F between o one and seven.
<ID> Maybe hold it.
<ID> So I think it's uh very uh very nice.
<UI> I give it a I give it a five.
<ID> What do you think?
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> So it's between one and seven?
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Seven is the highest uh?
<ME> Seven is the Mm-hmm.
<ID> I will give a six.
<PM> I will give a a five.
<UI> And you?
<ME> sorry.
<UI> Do you vote uh Christine?
<ME> eh?
<UI> Do you also vote?
<ME> No, I just want to see something Mm-hmm.
<ID> Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah.
<UI> Well, we can very easily.
<ME> Uh I think uh and need to as well.
<ID> No problem.
<ME> Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh.
<ID> So this is your One is most.
<UI> I So it will have five point five average.
<ME> Um.
<ID> Well, we can choose what we want.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay, let's say that seven is the best.
<ME> Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So so do note the grade we have five, six for me, five.
<PM> Five.
<ID> And what what's your choice?
<ME> Oh sorry.
<ME> Six Uh s you can how much what?
<ID> How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect?
<ID> How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire?
<ME> Oh yes I mm I dunno mm, I think six, it's a good uh Yeah.
<ID> Five point five average.
<ME> Wa can.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> Mm.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Well, does it Okay, techne technological aspect.
<ME> I sorry.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> So after, the technological aspect?
<ME> So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel.
<ID> Yeah, we have the wheel.
<ME> Uh.
<ID> We also have the rubber material, which make it uh like new also.
<ID> I think I would give a five.
<UI> It's four.
<ID> Four?
<PM> A four also, because, except for the wheel, we don't have so much innovation.
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> The rubber is Uh a four.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not?
<PM> I I Yeah.
<ID> No.
<UI> Huh?
<UI> No.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> So what's your uh grade?
<ME> No.
<ME> Four.
<ID> Four?
<ID> So we have four, four f and five?
<ME> We can put four?
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> For twenty five.
<ID> Yeah, four.
<ME> Everyone is okay or four poin Four.
<ID> Four, yeah, let's put four.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Doesn't it Yeah, I think so.
<ME> Very easy to use.
<ME> Do you think it's easy to use?
<UI> I give a seven, I think.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Six.
<ID> I would give a I would give a seven as well.
<ID> It's very easy to use.
<ME> Mm, six for me also.
<PM> Six.
<ID> So six point five.
<ME> Six point five.
<UI> 'Kay.
<PM> Six six six point five.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Is it fashion?
<ID> Oh yeah, its its f its fruit fruit shape.
<ME> Seven?
<ID> I would say seven.
<ID> And is very very nice design.
<ME> Yeah it's fashion, because it's a fruit, and we say that the yeah, seven.
<UI> Yeah, we can we can put a seven here.
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah, seven.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Seven, okay.
<UI> Well, we hope.
<PM> Easy to find.
<ME> Uh easy to find in a room?
<PM> I lost my banana.
<ID> I think you can't miss it.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah?
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Uh.
<UI> Yeah, I think it's cool.
<UI> I think we can put a six here.
<ME> We have the lightning, or The lighting.
<ID> Yeah, we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow.
<UI> So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely, or Yeah.
<ID> It's okay.
<ID> I think it's very easy to I would say seven.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Seven?
<ID> It's hard to miss it.
<PM> Six.
<PM> Yeah, okay.
<ME> Is it is it robust?
<ID> Yeah, it's rubber, made of rubber, I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control.
<PM> Uh f yeah, it's ru it's rubber.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah the only problem there might be which know, i if it's very sensitive, they will, I don't know Yeah, okay.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So maybe we can put a six.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Mm.
<PM> Six or five.
<ME> Everybody is okay, six.
<PM> Five.
<ID> Six is okay?
<UI> Six, yeah, for me.
<PM> Six.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> S now um so.
<ID> Tadada.
<ID> We have to sum up everything.
<UI> Twenty.
<ME> Thirteen uh, twenty, twenty six point five, uh seven, thirty two, thirty six.
<UI> Thirty.
<UI> Thir Okay.
<ME> That's that's okay?
<ME> Six.
<ID> Six is a good Yeah, the be.
<ME> Good.
<ME> Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better, and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product, I think.
<UI> Yeah, the top Mm.
<ID> Okay, so six is a So it's a good evaluation, I think.
<UI> So will become eight soon?
<ID> It's very promising.
<UI> Yeah, well it's a bit biased.
<ME> We have a good price and uh.
<ID> Huh.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Good.
<ID> So this prototype is quite nice.
<UI> Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped, uh wireless phones not mobile ones, wireless for the house, uh quite big also, and they were selling something like a hundred Euros, two hundred Euros.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> Just a just a phone, wireless.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive, I think.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> I think the Yeah.
<PM> But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, it's much more complex, but Okay.
<ID> So, I think, we can summarise.
<ID> So we have seen the prototype.
<ID> It's very nice according to the work of our two designer.
<ID> The the the financial aspect were okay.
<ID> We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit.
<ID> The the evaluation give satisfying result as well.
<ID> So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting.
<ID> So the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is okay, so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party.
<PM> Start to eat banana.
<ID> I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Okay so congratulation.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Congratulations to the team.
<ID> Nice product.
<UI> Uh very well, we worked together fantastically.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> I think it was a good collaboration uh.
<ID> Aspect.
<UI> So what does the management say?
<ID> Sorry?
<UI> What does the management say?
<ID> I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well.
<UI> Ah.
<ID> All it depends on who watch this meeting.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> We don't know.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Okay, so good guys, so see you for next uh successful project.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Fruits.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> Mm.
