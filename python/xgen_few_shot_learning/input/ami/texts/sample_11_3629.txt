<ME> Hmm.
<ID> What should it look like?
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Hmm.
<ID> Oh, let's kick it off.
<ID> Oh, there we go.
<ID> So, our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set, so, which has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> I took this off our corporate website.
<ID> It's I think well it sums up what we need to do.
<ID> We're inspired by latest fashion, not only electronics, but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design.
<ID> That's why our product will always fit in your home.
<ID> So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market.
<ID> So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> So So we put the fashion in electronics.
<ID> So that's what we need to go for.
<ID> Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps, three pha uh three phase of design.
<ID> First step will be the functional design.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> And that's basically what we're gonna do.
<ID> Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards, so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short, since we had a technical problem.
<ID> So skip through this.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything, so to help with these, you have we have the SMARTboards here.
<ID> We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation.
<ID> I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, so it's actually it's very easy.
<ID> Like it says, very simple, you just take out the pen.
<ID> Like you see here, I'll just take the take here.
<ID> That's it, you just put it on the board.
<ID> You see a pen here.
<ID> You go here, just like using a pen.
<ID> You can just draw whatever you want.
<ID> It's like the eraser, can erase whatever you want.
<ID> And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views, if you wanna change the format, you just either take out jus just like the pen, and whatever you want, your current colour, your line width, just to make the line bigger.
<ID> So it should be really easy.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> This is to take the just take a new slide and back again.
<ID> We're just gonna keep using this board all the time, so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone, I suppose.
<ID> So I'll take this out.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> We'll use that later.
<ID> Anyway.
<ID> Yeah, just just just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder, like I put my presentation now.
<ID> I'll put the the minutes of every meeting, I'll put them there too, so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever.
<ID> So next, been here.
<ID> Well, gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot.
<ID> So basic idea is we have a blank sheet.
<ID> Just try whatever you want, and like it says, draw your favourite animal.
<ID> I think the creative genius should go first.
<PM> The creative genius?
<PM> Thank you very much.
<ID> So, draw us your favourite animal.
<PM> Well, I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing, so I'm not really good at drawing animals, but uh the animal which I Oh.
<ID> Draw us a technical animal.
<ID> Yeah, it's still erasing.
<PM> Pen.
<PM> Uh format.
<PM> Else my animal will be like king-size.
<PM> I pretty much like a dolphin, because of its uh its freedom basically.
<PM> Let's see.
<PM> A head.
<PM> actually worked with this.
<PM> It's like uh it's a very Uh high-tech.
<PM> Bit low-responsive though.
<PM> Prefer pen and paper.
<ID> So that's what we don't want.
<ID> We want a high-responsive product.
<ID> So It looks more like nuclear bomb.
<ME> Very nice dolphin.
<PM> It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb.
<PM> This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want.
<PM> So Yeah, well it does look like a nuclear bomb.
<ID> Let's go easy on it.

<UI> It is uh it knows exactly what it wants.
<UI> Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources.
<ID> What does it want?
<UI> Uh well, basically uh it hunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well-thought way.
<UI> Uh it knows exactly what it wants.
<UI> It never kills an animal uh just for the killing, so it's very efficient.
<UI> And it tries to do everything as fast as possible.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> And it always goes for uh security, in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything, security, speed and efficiency is important.

<PM> Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.
<PM> No rational changes or whatever, 'cause it revolutionary changes, yes.
<ID> Okay, so very intuitive design, I guess.
<PM> Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product.

<PM> TV is becoming central in most homes.
<PM> Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh, yeah, to be able to use it as well?
