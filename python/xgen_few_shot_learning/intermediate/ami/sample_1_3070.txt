### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.
<ID> You have to paint now.
<ME> Oh.
<ID> So you're next.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Well we will try.
<ME> Where it going?
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> That's uh strange.
<ID> What is going on?
<UI> pop-ups.
<ID> What are you What?
<ME> Hmm.
<UI> What is this, Pictionary.
<ME> Uh Mm.
<ID> Um Is a It is a It is a A duck.
<UI> Uh a bird.

<ID> Hmm.
<ME> Now uh blank?
<ID> Blank, yes.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> No problem.
<UI> Shit happens.
<ME> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> A parrot.
<ME> Wow.
<UI> Ish.
<ME> Oh.
<UI> He did it before.

<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<PM> How do you wear this thing?
<ID> Hmm.
<ID> Mm mm mm.
<PM> Not too many cables and stuff.
<PM> Original.
<ID> Is recorded?
<ID> Okay?
<ID> Okay so welcome everyone.
<ID> So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control.
<ID> So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff, then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it.
<ID> And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process.
<ID> So sorry?
<PM> Uh.
<PM> Just one thing.
<PM> Uh, you said twenty-five minutes, but I have something else to do uh, so gotta have another meeting uh soon, so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true.
<PM> I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah.
<ID> You have another meeting soon?
<ID> So you have to be quick.
<PM> Yeah, for the lawnmower project.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original, we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly.
<ID> So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points.
<ID> First it will be the functional design.
<ID> Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design.
<ID> So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function the remote control should fulfil.
<ID> And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved, what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that.
<ID> And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point.
<ID> So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board.
<PM> What an original idea.
<ID> Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us?
<PM> Orangutan.
<ID> Okay that's good.
<UI> No no n You should write y the name I think.
<ID> n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment.
<PM> Can I give you the no?
<PM> But I don't have to say anything.
<PM> When I'm drawing the orangutan.
<PM> It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan.
<ID> Okay it's an abstract drawing.
<PM> Yes.
<ID> I think it's nice and original.
<PM> I don't have a red colour.
<PM> Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen, so Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> You want to draw something Christine?
<ME> Okay uh sorry.
<ME> You have to imagine a little bit um.
<ME> This Sorry too uh.
<ID> Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost.
<PM> Yes.
<PM> I know.
<ID> Is this uh Ah okay it's pretty.
<PM> Wha what is this strange beast?
<ME> Is it beautiful?
<PM> Is it a monster?
<ME> Do you know?
<ME> It's a cat.
<PM> It's a cat?
<ME> Isn't it?
<PM> I thought these things did not exist.
<ME> Yes yes is it like that.
<UI> Me Ah yeah.
<ME> Is it better?
<PM> Ah yeah Does have a name?
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> It's my cat.
<ID> Okay it's your cat.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> The name is Caramel.
<PM> Caramel.
<UI> Caramel.
<PM> Ah-ha.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Olivier, do you want to Okay I go, but next time you'll do something I'm sure.
<UI> And you I think I'm too short for the cables.
<PM> Next time I concentrate.
<ID> I'm a bit short on cable.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So what could I draw?
<ID> Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow.
<ID> I don't know if it looks like a cow Like a what?
<PM> He looks like a bong.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Sorry.
<PM> No.
<UI> Quite squarey.
<PM> Scary?
<UI> He also.
<ID> I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say.
<UI> Mm.
<PM> I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos, no.
<ID> Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control.
<PM> That's I is there a matter for a new remote control?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Let's move on.
<ID> So Here the uh financial objective of our project.
<ID> That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros.
<ID> Yeah if it's trendy, original I d fulfil the user needs.
<PM> Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control?
<ID> We have to discuss that point.
<PM> Ah this is not defined at all?
<ID> On yeah you you can suggest points like this.
<PM> Ah, okay.
<ID> So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple.
<ID> So what's what are your ideas about that?
<ID> Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side?
<PM> Well uh do we sell other stuff?
<PM> Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device, otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us.
<ID> Okay, so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Do you agree?
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> So maybe it should be for multiple devices.
<ID> And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil?
<UI> I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part.
<PM> No, I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now.
<UI> I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice.
<ID> Few buttons.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark?
<ID> Might be a good idea.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain, what it shouldn't it should look like, or things like that?
<UI> Something which is not squarey maybe uh, not a box.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> With rou okay.
<ID> Like for okay.
<PM> Something like that, least fits in your hand.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> The basic requirement.
<ID> So.
<ID> Fit in your hand, yeah.
<PM> Only a buck.
<ID> And also it have, i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To, to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Waterproof.
<ID> Water-proof as well.
<UI> And I think we should have a device Sorry.
<ID> Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't.
<ID> Maybe water-proof would be very original.
<ID> Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> That could be uh Yeah but, it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah, mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well.
<PM> B it seems uh so, but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And, and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it.
<PM> That's people they actually do it themselves.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> directly.
<PM> I it will look a bulky in that case.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Maybe we can sell uh all that together, so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well.
<ID> That might be good uh track to follow.
<PM> Like as an optional thing.
<ID> Optional or selled with it?
<UI> And I I think we should have something, most of the time I I lose my remote control.
<UI> We should have s uh special bu button on the TV to make the remote control beeping.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the TV.
<UI> Ah yeah.
<ID> Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep.
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> Barks.
<ID> Yeah, barks, yeah.
<UI> Barks.
<ID> So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control?
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah whistle.
<ID> I don't know, whistle-able?
<UI> Whistle tracking.
<ID> Th Whistle tracking yeah.
<ID> Whistle tracking remote control.
<ID> That's a good idea, that's very original and that's can uh improve.
<PM> That's that's quite cool, but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right?
<ID> Yeah d d uh.
<PM> So i it's just going to add t to the cost.
<ID> Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors.
<ID> I think this is a good advantage.
<PM> It's cool.
<PM> I think I like the idea, but I'm not sure about the what you, who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> We have to ask Yeah.
<PM> Who's Yeah.
<ID> We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Which is you.
<PM> 'Kay.
<UI> yeah Okay.
<ID> Okay so try to find that for next meeting.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh.
<UI> Don't panic.
<ID> Don't pani.
<ID> So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, and what would be convenient for the user.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements, what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user.
<ID> So.
<ID> And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> So.
<ID> Thank you I think that's all for this point.
<PM> Good.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Uh, so we come back in five minutes?
<PM> Half an hour.
<ID> Anyway you will receive some messages.
<ID> Be careful.
<ID> You eat it?
<ID> Does it move uh?
<ID> Okay, but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh We'll see.
<UI> Ah.

### Assistant: The meeting was about designing a remote control for a TV. The group discussed ideas for the design, including making it durable, having a device to help find it when lost, and using a small amount of batteries. They also discussed the need to have a device that is easy to use and trendy. The goal is to have a remote control that is original and user-friendly. The design will be divided into three main points: functional design, conceptual design, and desired design. The group will draw animals on a whiteboard to help come up with ideas. The goal is to have a production cost lower than 12.5 Euros and a selling price of twice that price to target a profit of 50 million Euros.
