A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.
<ID> You have to paint now.
<ME> Oh.
<ID> So you're next.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Well we will try.
<ME> Where it going?
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> That's uh strange.
<ID> What is going on?
<UI> pop-ups.
<ID> What are you What?
<ME> Hmm.
<UI> What is this, Pictionary.
<ME> Uh Mm.
<ID> Um Is a It is a It is a A duck.
<UI> Uh a bird.
<UI> Bird.
<ME> So Now save?
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> Now uh blank?
<ID> Blank, yes.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> No problem.
<UI> Shit happens.
<ME> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> A parrot.
<ME> Wow.
<UI> Ish.
<ME> Oh.
<UI> He did it before.
<PM> Uh No, no.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Nice.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<PM> Hmm.
<ID> Good morning everybody.
<UI> Good morning.
<ME> Good morning.
<PM> Good morning.
<ID> So, we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television.
<ID> And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly.
<ID> So people can can use it without any any problem.
<ID> I don't know.
<UI> Well, I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh Yeah, from the account manager.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> B did you send us an email about this?
<ID> Uh, not yet, but if you want Do you want do you want me to send you a mail?
<PM> Yeah, we we received an email about this uh d designs.
<PM> Ah it's Okay.
<ID> Or Uh.
<ME> Or you can put it in the shared folder.
<PM> Yeah, you see the email?
<PM> You email.
<PM> The v very no, no the first one.
<ME> No, I didn't get it.
<PM> It's inside.
<ME> This one.
<PM> No, no.
<ME> No.
<PM> The third one.
<PM> Oh, you didn't get anything.
<ME> No, .
<PM> It's strange.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> I got an email about the dis about the discussion.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> You get email, .
<PM> I dunno from who.
<PM> From the account manager.
<PM> You have received the same email, right?
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, I think so.
<PM> Yeah, so each of us has a role to do.
<ME> Yeah I think assign your uh roles.
<ID> S For each for each one.
<PM> In each We already have our role.
<ME> For each person, yeah.
<PM> 'Kay, we can So there are three kinds of designs, that's all.
<ID> So there are so we have three f yeah.
<ID> We have functional design, conceptual design, and detail design.
<PM> Okay, alright.
<ID> So, who will be the the responsible for the functional design?
<ID> Any any volunteer?
<UI> I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager.
<PM> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh No, I'm doing the interface.
<PM> I'm doing the interface.
<ID> You are doing th.
<PM> Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay.
<UI> Yeah I I'm I'm Well, maybe we have okay so I industrial design.
<UI> It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright.
<ID> Okay, I'll for industrial design.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> And and you Norman?
<PM> Mm?
<PM> Um working on i.
<UI> User.
<PM> User interface.
<ID> And And doing the marketing.
<ME> Uh, I'm into marketing.
<ME> yeah nothing much in the project.
<ID> Nothing related here to the Next.
<ME> Marketing in this design.
<ME> A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface.
<PM> Yes.
<PM> You see the second mail?
<PM> Yeah, it's inside.
<PM> Go down.
<PM> Appendix.
<ME> Yeah, this is.
<PM> See there's a role for everybody.
<ME> Yeah, that's right, first.
<PM> Even for the marketing.
<ME> us user define.
<PM> But look at your role, your marketing role.
<ME> There's a trend watching.
<ID> I don't know.
<PM> Yeah, that's your role.
<ID> I.
<UI> Well, I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the Well, w we want to have a new re remote control for for TV distribution I guess.
<ID> About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later, no?
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<UI> So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh how we can make it work.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Yes.
<ME> I mean working remotes we already have.
<ME> This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls.
<UI> Yeah, I dunno I Yeah.
<ID> What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics.
<ID> And of course it should not be very costly.
<ME> Yeah, that's right.
<ID> So About the about what?
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting, or Yeah.
<PM> Need to collect information.
<PM> Um.
<PM> I I'm part of design, perhaps.
<PM> Uh, what is most important in a in a remote control?
<PM> What is the most important function aspect?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> You mean the external or Yeah of g of course.
<UI> Well, you have to make it work.
<UI> That's the that's the big thing.
<PM> That's alright.
<PM> Yeah, it should be easy to work with.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> We can think about an interface with uh well Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Uh.
<PM> We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface.
<PM> You just tell the television I want which channel.
<PM> Or or you can say for example, um I want uh to list all the programme tonight.
<ID> You won't I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly.
<PM> Y you know, instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you, so you don't have to look for the channel you want.
<PM> Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight.
<PM> Or a button for all the magazines, all the information documentary tonight.
<PM> And then you list a few, and I will choose from the list.
<PM> So instead of pressing the channel number, I am choosing the programmes directly.
<PM> Yeah, that's one way of uh making it useful.
<PM> No, because no, it's not very a lot.
<ID> S Like s uh you you you say we can use speech.
<PM> Th this information exists.
<PM> For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything.
<PM> The the idea of using speech to reduce the button, but uh and it's more natural.
<UI> I I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> I'm a okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control.
<ID> In the hand.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the TV itself could have it.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yes, possible.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> But Yeah.
<ME> And I could talk to the TV television itself.
<ID> Except if if you are far from the TV.
<ME> I need not have an I mean we have some or something, different technology but Mm-hmm, yeah.
<ID> This is it's Mm-hmm.
<PM> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch TV channel, there's a option you can choose, either TV channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme.
<UI> On the content.
<UI> Yeah, yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to Yeah yeah.
<PM> So it's more powerful.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> No.
<PM> No, because you see now all the TV programmes are available on the webs.
<PM> They they are they are they are available in XML format or whatever the format.
<PM> We don't care.
<PM> We just say that this are some content.
<PM> We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes.
<PM> Some of the websites they already provide this service, so we can just use the service available.
<PM> Download it uh to the to this remote control.
<PM> And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories, or sev seven.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> The most there are only seven buttons.
<PM> So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button, for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want, so you don't have to choose among hundred channels, if you have hundred channels, you just have six buttons, seven buttons.
<ID> Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons.
<UI> Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way, so Yeah in the dis display on the TV screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Yeah, yeah.
<ID> This is good idea.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Ah, yes.
<PM> So.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah, so you don't have to display here, just display on the TV screen, right?
<PM> Good idea.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> I think I think that will be revol revolutionary.
<PM> Because all the TV uh the the remote control have all numbers, lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Oh right so Please, Norman, draw uh Okay.
<PM> Alright.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> So we have five minutes to Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so, can we S You it.
<PM> Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board.
<PM> Five minutes.
<ME> And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So, I mean, if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene, the lights adapt themself.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> The lighting in the room changes.
<PM> Yeah, but we are designing just remote control.
<ME> I mean, we have a option in the remote control.
<ME> If we want to have that option, you press that button in the remote.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Okay, do you want to have a conceptual remote control there, or you just want to put the function in?
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> If if you you you can if you want you can use th the.
<PM> Go on, draw something.
<ME> Oh, I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Where is it?
<ME> The lapel.
<ID> Or before the before the the design that says.
<PM> Ah, okay.
<PM> Where where is it?
<PM> Here.
<ME> Yeah, that one.
<ME> Just plug it.
<ID> Norman.
<ME> Yeah, that's right.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Okay, alright.
<PM> So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Right?
<PM> We agree on that, right?
<PM> Uh, uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Uh to choose uh content s or channels.
<PM> So we have both.
<PM> The user can choose w which one they want, right?
<UI> Yeah, by content or by channel, it's a good idea.
<PM> By content or by channel.
<PM> Choose by contents or by channels.
<PM> So And then what did we say just now?
<PM> Other than this.
<UI> And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> Okay, so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content.
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> Challenge.
<UI> I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Content.
<PM> Okay, so these we have to work it out.
<PM> So this one of the problem.
<PM> And uh The main thing.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Alright.
<PM> Alright, okay.
<PM> So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting, so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer?
<PM> That's the first aspect.
<PM> Right.
<PM> We will get information and then we'll come back in.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Thank you everybody.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah, we'll come.
<ID> So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes?
<ID> And we'll discuss the other other aspects.
<PM> Alright.
<PM> Alright, okay.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Well thank you all.

### Assistant: The group discussed the new remote control design and its characteristics. They discussed the importance of having a user-friendly and user interface. They also discussed the need to have a remote control to be of a small size and easy to use. The group also discussed the need to have a remote control that would be able to be able to be used with speech recognition technology. They also discussed the need for the remote control to be able to be used to be able to be used to be used with speech recognition technology.
