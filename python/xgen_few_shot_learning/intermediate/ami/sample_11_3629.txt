### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.

<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.

<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> Okay, good morning.
<ID> This is our first team meeting.
<PM> Good day.
<ME> Morning.
<UI> Morning.
<ID> I'll be your Project Manager for today, for this project.
<ID> My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off.
<ID> That's my uh that's the agenda for today.
<ID> Well, of course we're new to each other, so I'd like to get acquainted first.
<ID> So let's do that first, I mean Let's start with you, can you introduce yourself?
<ID> You're our Marketing Expert.
<ME> Yes.
<ME> Um my name is Dirk, Dirk Meinfeld.
<ME> Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert.
<ME> And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product.
<ID> Okay, excellent.
<ID> And you are User Interface Yeah.
<PM> Nick Broer, User Interface Designer.
<PM> I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view.
<ID> Excellent.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> My name is Xavier Juergens, I'm the Industrial Designer, and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today.
<UI> First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus, second is what is uh the apparatus made of, and the third is what should it look like.
<ME> Hmm.
<ID> What should it look like?
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Hmm.
<ID> Oh, let's kick it off.
<ID> Oh, there we go.
<ID> So, our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set, so, which has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> I took this off our corporate website.
<ID> It's I think well it sums up what we need to do.
<ID> We're inspired by latest fashion, not only electronics, but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design.
<ID> That's why our product will always fit in your home.
<ID> So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market.
<ID> So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> So So we put the fashion in electronics.
<ID> So that's what we need to go for.
<ID> Anyway, we'll take this project in three steps, three pha uh three phase of design.
<ID> First step will be the functional design.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> And that's basically what we're gonna do.
<ID> Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards, so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short, since we had a technical problem.
<ID> So skip through this.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything, so to help with these, you have we have the SMARTboards here.
<ID> We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation.
<ID> I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, so it's actually it's very easy.
<ID> Like it says, very simple, you just take out the pen.
<ID> Like you see here, I'll just take the take here.
<ID> That's it, you just put it on the board.
<ID> You see a pen here.
<ID> You go here, just like using a pen.
<ID> You can just draw whatever you want.
<ID> It's like the eraser, can erase whatever you want.
<ID> And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views, if you wanna change the format, you just either take out jus just like the pen, and whatever you want, your current colour, your line width, just to make the line bigger.
<ID> So it should be really easy.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> This is to take the just take a new slide and back again.
<ID> We're just gonna keep using this board all the time, so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone, I suppose.
<ID> So I'll take this out.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> We'll use that later.
<ID> Anyway.
<ID> Yeah, just just just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder, like I put my presentation now.
<ID> I'll put the the minutes of every meeting, I'll put them there too, so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever.
<ID> So next, been here.
<ID> Well, gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot.
<ID> So basic idea is we have a blank sheet.
<ID> Just try whatever you want, and like it says, draw your favourite animal.
<ID> I think the creative genius should go first.
<PM> The creative genius?
<PM> Thank you very much.
<ID> So, draw us your favourite animal.
<PM> Well, I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing, so I'm not really good at drawing animals, but uh the animal which I Oh.
<ID> Draw us a technical animal.
<ID> Yeah, it's still erasing.
<PM> Pen.
<PM> Uh format.
<PM> Else my animal will be like king-size.
<PM> I pretty much like a dolphin, because of its uh its freedom basically.
<PM> Let's see.
<PM> A head.
<PM> actually worked with this.
<PM> It's like uh it's a very Uh high-tech.
<PM> Bit low-responsive though.
<PM> Prefer pen and paper.
<ID> So that's what we don't want.
<ID> We want a high-responsive product.
<ID> So It looks more like nuclear bomb.
<ME> Very nice dolphin.
<PM> It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb.
<PM> This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want.
<PM> So Yeah, well it does look like a nuclear bomb.
<ID> Let's go easy on it.
<PM> I'll just finish up real soon, because I'm So it doesn't really look like a dolphin, but then again, this is all new for me.
<ID> Anyway, it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin, you like the freedom that it that it represents.
<UI> Uh-huh.
<PM> Like the ocean, like swimming.
<PM> Do that in my spare time, so that's basically an Now we can forget this ever happened.
<ID> What do you like?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Well, our Marketing Expert.
<ID> Show us an animal.
<ME> Um an animal.
<ME> I like the elephant.
<ID> Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet.
<ID> Oh.
<ME> What?
<ID> Take a clean sheet first.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Um Oh yeah.
<ID> Just press next.
<ID> That's it.
<ME> Oh, a blank.
<ME> Okay, next.
<ME> Free, I like the elephant.
<ME> It's big, it's strong, so uh uh Oh, it's a little bit You have to hold it, right?
<PM> It's not really that responsive, no.
<UI> Mm.
<ME> Hmm.
<ME> It's a beautiful animal.
<ME> Oh, you have to p press it pretty hard.
<ME> With a smile on it, it's very important.
<ID> It's a cute elephant.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> And uh not to forget its tail.
<ME> Oh.
<ID> It's a nice beard.
<ME> Yeah, it's okay.
<PM> And you was making comments on my dolphin.
<ME> Yes.
<ME> I will beat the dolphin.
<ME> No.
<ID> Okay, so it's just a bee.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market.
<ID> The big and strong player in the market.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> This would be good.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay, excellent.
<ID> On to the next one.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Uh yeah.
<UI> Okay, you should press next.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Press next.
<ID> Yeah, it's up there.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> That's it.
<UI> Okay, well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger.
<PM> You picked a hard one, didn't you?
<ME> Experience with the tiger.
<UI> My drawing skills are really bad, so.
<ME> What?
<ME> They are Okay uh-huh.
<UI> They are really bad, my drawing skills.
<ID> Sure looks smooth.
<ME> Oh.
<UI> I'm not sure how the legs should go, but Uh these are stripes.
<PM> Got it.
<UI> I've picked this animal because it's very fast.
<UI> It is uh it knows exactly what it wants.
<UI> Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources.
<ID> What does it want?
<UI> Uh well, basically uh it hunts for prey, but it does it always in a very well-thought way.
<UI> Uh it knows exactly what it wants.
<UI> It never kills an animal uh just for the killing, so it's very efficient.
<UI> And it tries to do everything as fast as possible.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> And it always goes for uh security, in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything, security, speed and efficiency is important.
<ME> Mm.
<UI> And I think uh those things we can use.
<ID> I agree.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Yay, I'm supposed to draw the animal next.
<ID> I introduce to the world the amazing ant.
<ME> Uh hard worker.
<ID> Great team-workers.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Do everything to Uh really small, but together they're really strong.
<ID> So I'm gonna give it a smiley face.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Not sure where the p.
<ID> Just put 'em here.
<ID> Whatever.
<ID> Think it need shoes.
<ID> So I'm just too lazy to draw it all black, so That's the coolest ant ever.
<PM> You've done this before, haven't you?
<ID> I love to draw ants.
<ID> It's my hobby.
<ID> Anyway Nah.
<ID> Just I think it's very representative what we drew, I guess.
<ID> Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Just Yeah.
<ID> You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have, and just make it a little distinct.
<ID> Anyway.
<ID> another beep to stop the meeting.
<ID> See.
<ID> Warning.
<ID> Finish meeting now.
<ID> Uh put this down.
<ID> Examples.
<ID> Well I guess we have a little little time extra, but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work.
<ID> So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short.
<ID> I'll start with you.
<ID> What are y What are your first ideas for the new product?
<PM> Well, I basically had a question.
<ID> What The project I got was just for a TV remote control.
<PM> Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control?
<PM> Is it just the TV or do we want to in Just for TV remote control.
<ME> Uh Yeah.
<ID> Yeah, I guess so.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Well, I was thinking about design remote control, with our uh motto and all.
<ME> But Yeah.
<PM> Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with.
<PM> No rational changes or whatever, 'cause it revolutionary changes, yes.
<ID> Okay, so very intuitive design, I guess.
<PM> Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product.
<PM> So that was something I wanted to add, and perhaps some usability aspect.
<PM> TV is becoming central in most homes.
<PM> Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh, yeah, to be able to use it as well?
<ID> Yeah, we want I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it.
<ID> So I think I mean, really disabled people, yeah, might be a problem, but I think it's a little take it into consideration.
<ID> Um yeah.
<ID> I think we really need to cut the meeting short.
<ID> You have anything you wanna share quickly?
<UI> Hmm.
<ME> Uh.
<UI> Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of, it should be something light.
<UI> That's it speaks for itself, but some uh Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> It should be light, okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Um, let's see, where did I Let's skip that.
<ID> Oh, this is it.
<ID> Sorry, I skipped this sheet.
<ME> Selling price.
<ID> What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price, twenty five Euros.
<ID> That's for you.
<ID> The production price, twelve and a half Euros, approximately.
<UI> Okay.

<ID> We'll reach the uh reach that profit.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Okay, well that's not that much to work with.
<ME> international.
<ID> No, it's not much to work on.
<ID> I'm sorry, I skipped it.
<ID> Anyways, that's Yeah, this is it.
