A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.

<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> No problem.
<UI> Shit happens.
<ME> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now.

<UI> Oh.
<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> Okay.
<ID> Good morning everybody.
<UI> Good morning.
<ID> Oh, everybody is not ready.
<PM> Uh almost.
<PM> Ready.
<ID> Alright.
<ID> Okay, let's go.
<ID> So, we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes.
<ID> Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager.
<ID> Um you are the Okay.
<PM> I'm uh Michael.
<PM> I'm the user interface designer.
<ME> Hi I'm Guillermo.
<ME> I'm the Marketing Expert.
<UI> And I am Hemant, the industrial designer.
<ID> Okay, very good.
<ID> Thanks for being here.
<ID> Um so let's have a look to the the agenda.
<ID> So, we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here.
<ID> Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it.
<ID> So, the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control.
<ID> Um it should be original, trendy, and also user friendly.
<ID> As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company.
<ID> It is in three step as you know.
<ID> First the functional design.
<ID> The second's a conceptual design, and then the detailed design.
<ID> During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately, individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next.
<ID> So first, we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings.
<ID> So who want to start?
<PM> Ah well if no one else wants to, yeah.
<ID> Mister.
<PM> Okay so, want me to draw my favourite animal.
<PM> Let's see.
<PM> Well, I don't really have a favourite animal, but um uh I think I have one in mind, so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board.
<ID> You have one in mind?
<PM> The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs, and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions.
<PM> Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes.
<PM> There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web.
<PM> And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else.
<PM> So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away.
<PM> So, that's my animal.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Th thank you.
<ID> Very interesting.
<ID> Guillermo you want to?
<ME> 'kay I dunno why, but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther, or maybe yes.
<UI> But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther?
<ME> Uh yeah yeah.
<UI> So bad I don't like it.
<ID> It would be very funny for us.
<ID> Oh.
<ME> Okay it's a friendly panther.
<PM> Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone.
<ME> Yeah maybe.
<ME> Um.
<ME> Actually, honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour, I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh, I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt, so but I like it because it's fast, and it's black as well, so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful, strong, uh I dunno.
<ME> I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Thank you.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Hemant.
<UI> Um sure.
<PM> So you don't like pink panthers?
<ME> I like it.
<UI> Oh yeah.
<UI> Thanks.
<UI> This lapel is coming out once in a while.
<UI> It's not very strong.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> So, not the favourite animal, but I think I'll draw elephant.
<UI> I'll try to draw elephant.
<UI> It's a problem.
<UI> Okay, thanks.
<UI> Okay so, elephant goes like this, and then it has four feet.
<UI> I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not, but I think this is the easiest.
<UI> And then we have it's trunk.
<UI> And yep something like this.
<UI> An eye, cute.
<UI> Yeah, so and sometimes they have a hump.
<ID> Poor elephant.
<UI> It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking.
<UI> So when they walk, wherever they are going to put their first feet, the second feet will always be.
<UI> When they'll come to that position the second, the third feet will be there.
<UI> That's the way they walk.
<UI> And that's very peculiar about them.
<UI> None of the other animals walk like this.
<UI> And they are very useful to human beings.
<UI> At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something, or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another, elephants were very useful.
<UI> And they are found in um usually the warm countries.
<UI> And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal.
<UI> That's what I know about them.
<UI> So, that's what I wanted to tell about elephants.
<PM> So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant, 'cause you haven't drawn the ears?
<UI> There are two kind of uh yeah, they are very different, Indian and African elephants.
<UI> So Indian elephant is having one bump, I think, and the African have two.
<UI> And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals, these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there?
<ID> Yes.
<ID> We have to I have to catch you, sorry.
<UI> Wind up?
<UI> Okay, some other time.
<ID> We have to to go through the meeting.
<PM> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Thank you.
<PM> We can discuss that off-line.
<ID> Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants.
<UI> Thanks.
<ID> So so another important part of the project is about money, uh and about so about finances.
<ID> So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros, okay.
<ID> And we should target the inter an international market.
<PM> So could I just ask one question, um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling?
<PM> So it's gonna be you already have a TV but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something?
<ID> O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly, so let's go to it.
<PM> Okay, alright.
<ID> So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go.
<ID> Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device?
<ID> Should it be a universal one?
<ID> And uh etcetera.
<ID> So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go.
<PM> Okay well, so, it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make, which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet, but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so, I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know, what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control, so it's Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah.
<UI> Marketing person.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go.
<ID> So we need to close the meeting.
<ID> Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do.
<ID> So um you have to work on the on the working design, you have to uh work on the technical functions, and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs, alright?
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Um you will receive some information by emails, i as usual.
<ID> Thanks for coming today.
<PM> Okay.
<UI> Thanks.
<ID> Thanks.
<PM> Alright.
