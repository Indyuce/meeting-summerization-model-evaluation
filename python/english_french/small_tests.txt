-Fiji Water nearly lost its claim to fame this week because the military government in Fiji increased the tax on water extraction from one-third of a Fijian cent to 15 Fijian cents.
-Fiji Water responded by firing all of the employees in Fiji and closing the plant.  However, the company quickly agreed to pay the higher tax and the plant is now up and running again.
-Fiji Water is very important to the economy of Fiji.  It is the number one export of any kind from the country in dollar value and has been around for only a decade.

Fiji Water is a bottled water brand that is owned by the American company Nestle.  The water is sourced from an aquifer in Fiji.  In 2007, the Fijian government increased the tax on water extraction from the aquifer, which nearly caused the company to close its operations in Fiji.  However, the company responded by firing all of its Fijian employees and closing the plant, but reopened the plant after agreeing to pay the higher tax.  The author of this article, Charles Fishman, visited the Fiji Water plant in 2007 and interviewed the owners of the company.  He later wrote an article for Fast Company about the company's operations in Fiji.<|endoftext|>
