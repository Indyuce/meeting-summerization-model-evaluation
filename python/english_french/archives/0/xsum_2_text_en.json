The damage to the runways has made the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, and the destruction of the airport could be more difficult to repair than at Qayyarah air base, where only part of the main runway was damaged. The tactics employed by Islamic State militants include levelling almost every structure at the airport and demolishing buildings in order to clear the line of sight for defensive positions. The airstrikes have caused some damage to the buildings, but the images show that the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact.",
