Mr. Trump has won three of the four previous polls held so far. The three men are seeking to be nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in the November election. The Republican candidates have finally understood that Donald Trump could win this race, but it may be too late. For more than two hours, senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have repeatedly struck Trump with blows. They have attacked his professional background, criticized his conservative references, and questioned his policies and reliance on the E-brouwe. We are having a lot of fun here, aren't we? joked one of the candidates at a certain point. But the truth is that Mr. Trump has been on his heels for a good part of the evening. The challenge for the men who want to dethrone the leader is that the best moment to strike comes before you realize that the circumstances require it. In a campaign where authenticity is highly valued, the fireworks of Thursday may resemble the kind of political opportunism that many associate with traditional politicians. Cruz and Rubio have both attacked Trump twice, and what makes the Super Tuesday so great? - The long day of voting explained The Republicans who hate Trump - The long-time members of the party express themselves M. Rubio, who came in second in several recent competitions, launched a series of attacks against M. Trump. If he hadn't inherited $200 million, you know where Donald Trump would be, he said, declaring during a heated exchange. He would sell watches in Manhattan. M. Rubio also criticized the Trump University education online business, which failed, and accused him of hiring foreign workers instead of Americans in his construction projects. M. Trump responded: 'I've hired thousands of people. You haven't hired anyone.' The billionaire real estate mogul has been increasingly on the defensive about his businesses and conservative references. In other exchanges, it's all about their past. Trump about Rubio: 'This guy is an incompetent speaker on stage.' Rubio about Trump: 'You're a bad businessman.' If he hadn't inherited $200 million, Donald Trump would be somewhere today, selling watches in Manhattan. Trump about Cruz: 'This guy is a liar.' Response from Cruz: 'Accusing someone of lying is itself a lie, and that's something that Donald does every day.' Trump about Cruz: 'You don't get along with anyone. No Republican senator supports you. Not one. You should be ashamed of yourself.' 'I know you're embarrassed.' Rubio about Trump: 'You're the only person on this stage who has been sued for hiring workers illegally on your projects.' Response from Trump: 'I'm the only one on this stage who has hired thousands of people. You haven't hired anyone.'",
