    "text": " Eric Ciotti, one of the participants, proposes reducing taxes as a way to start streamlining expenses. He suggests eliminating the death tax, inheritance tax, and the tax on tax, as well as reducing the burden of income tax on a few tens of percent of French people. He also proposes lowering taxes instead of handing out checks with no funds, which will cost less and give a boost to job creation, wealth, and growth. Another participant, Aurélien Pradier, agrees with the need for budgetary efforts but believes that reducing public spending is more important. Bruno Retailleau suggests lowering taxes and addressing family policy, which was first destroyed by François Hollande and then accelerated by Emmanuel Macron. Eric Ciotti, Aurélien Pradier, and Bruno Retailleau all agree that taxes need to be lowered, but they differ in their approaches to achieving this goal.",
