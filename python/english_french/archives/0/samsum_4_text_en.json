How are the things at home?\nKate: At long last! Started to worry. Nothing new happening, if you disregard all that Xmas craze. Momo has recovered from her injury and frolicking again.\nKate: <file_photo>\nKate: Good old Momo! Yes, it is your scarf!\nOla: NO!!! It's one of my favorites! The one from Laos!\nKate: Too late. Momo thinks it belongs to her now. Get yourself a new one. They surely have nice ones there.\nOla: Not at all. Only cheapish cotton blouses with horrible multi-coloured embroidery or some equally horrible crochetted tops. No shawls or scarfs.\nOla: <file_photo>\nKate: Wait a sec!\nKate: <file_photo>\nKate: Isn't it similar?! Mum would probably like it. Why don't you?\nOla: Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually crappy.\nKate: And if you go to some boutique shop or something? Not at a market as in your pics?\nOla: I might try and find some. Would you like one too?\nKate: Not really. And Mum would prefer to be the only one with an authentic Cuban blouse :))\nOla: OK I'll have a look. Greets to everyone at home pls.\nKate: Take care!",
