Have you lost your passport?\nP1: I think so. I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place where I used it was in that big department store.\nP2: Where did you use your passport in the department store?\nP1: In the shoe section. I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my travel checks.\nP2: Well, let me call the shoe department to see if they have found a passport. Sorry, but your passport was not found there either.\nP1: What should I do then?\nP2: You can fill out this loss of object form and I will keep an eye open. These kinds of things usually end up reappearing, but I suggest you contact your embassy and explain your situation, so they can help you get a new passport in case it doesn't appear.\nP1: You're right. Would you have a pen?\nP2: Here you are.\nP1: Oh, I always feel like I'm losing something every time I travel.",
