How are things at home?\n\n- Kate: I'm glad to hear that everything is fine. Apart from not hearing from you, nothing new has happened. Momo has recovered from her injury and is back to her usual self.\n\n- Kate: <photo_of_file>\n\n- Kate: Good old Momo! Yes, that's your scarf from Laos!\n\n- Ola: NO! That's one of my favorites! The one from Laos!\n\n- Kate: Too late. Momo thinks it's hers now. Get yourself a new one. They have nice ones there.\n\n- Ola: Not at all. Only cheap cotton clothes with horrible multicolored embroidery or equally awful crochet tops. No scarves or headscarves.\n\n- Ola: <photo_of_file>\n\n- Kate: Hold on a second!\n\n- Kate: <photo_of_file>\n\n- Kate: Is it similar? Mummy would probably love it. Why not you?\n\n- Ola: Not a bad idea. But the quality is usually mediocre.\n\n- Kate: And if you went to a designer shop or something like that? Not on a market like on your photos?\n\n- Ola: I can try to find one. Would you like one too?\n\n- Kate: Not really. And mummy would prefer to be dressed in an authentic Cuban shirt:))\n\n- Ola: Okay, I'll have a look. Tell everyone at home to take care of themselves.\n\n- Kate: Take care!",
