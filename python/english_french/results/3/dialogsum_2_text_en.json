The first person, P1, is frustrated with his current job and wants to start his own business. P2 tries to dissuade him from starting a business, pointing out that starting a business is a lot of work and requires a lot of planning and research. P1 is not deterred and insists that he will start his own business anyway. P2 then explains that a business plan is a document that describes a business, its goals, and how it will be run. P1 is surprised to learn how much work writing a business plan actually is, and decides not to start his own business after all",
