According to the research team, these drugs are particularly promising for the treatment of resistant cancers. The prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the UK. Approximately one man in eight will be affected by prostate cancer at some point in their life. The cancer can sometimes be treated successfully with hormone treatments that target androgen receptors linked to male hormones. But some prostate cancers don't work this way. Instead, they create an abnormal form of androgen receptor that is not linked to hormone growth and does not respond to standard hormone treatment. This is the most common form of resistance in prostate cancer, which leads to aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancers. The latest research, published in Cancer Research, has shown that a new class of drugs reduced the production of two receptors. Professor Paul Workman, the study's author and the Institute's Director of Research, declared that it was a fascinating discovery. We call these inhibitors of Hsp90 \"network drugs\" because they attack several signals that are diverted in cancer at the same time through a network rather than through a single signaling pathway. These drugs may hit cancer harder than those that only target a single protein, and seem promising for preventing or overcoming drug resistance. Professor Workman declared that the next step was to test the inhibitors of Hsp90 in clinical trials on patients with aggressive and resistant prostate cancer. Johann de Bono, a professor of experimental cancer medicine at the Institute of Cancer Research, declared: 'These drugs are already the subject of clinical trials for several types of cancer, and I am thrilled that our studies suggest they might also benefit men with prostate cancer who have no other therapeutic options.'",
