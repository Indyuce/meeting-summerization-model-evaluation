A business plan needs an executive summary that highlights the idea in two pages or less. Then it needs to describe the company, including its legal structure, history, etc.\n\nP1: Okay, that seems easy enough.\n\nP2: Wait, there's more. Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services, how they're different from competitors, and do a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables, such as GDP per capita and the number of children in the population.\n\nP1: Geez, is that all?\n\nP2: Almost. The most important piece of information for investors is the financial analysis. You'll need to estimate sales, cash flow, and profits, so they'll know when they'll start seeing a return on their investment.\n\nP1: I think I'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business.",
