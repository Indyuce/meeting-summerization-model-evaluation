    "text": "\n\nThe UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first quarter of the year, driven by retail and services, but there was a 'notable slowdown' in growth from last year. The second quarter's growth was in line with economists' expectations. The ONS head of national accounts said the economy has experienced a slowdown in the first half of the year, with services, retail, and film production and distribution showing improvement, but weaker performance in construction and manufacturing pulled down overall growth. The IMF downgraded its forecast for UK economic growth this year due to the weak first-quarter figure. The Chancellor said the UK economy has grown consistently for four-and-a-half years, but he said the government needs to focus on restoring productivity growth to deliver higher wages and living standards. The shadow chancellor said the weak government has led to weak growth and continued data showing working families are being squeezed with wages not keeping up with prices. The chief economist of Aberdeen Asset Management said the growth pick-up is not substantial and the underlying trends do not look favorable with uncertainties around Brexit and pressure on household budgets from higher inflation.",
