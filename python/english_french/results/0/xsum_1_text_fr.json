    "text": "\n\nThe archives of British author, war hero, and adventurer Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor have been catalogued by the National Library of Scotland. The collection includes letters from Prince Charles and Truman Capote. Sir Patrick, who was known as Paddy, died in 2011 at the age of 96. He published several books on his travels around the world, and one of the most valuable pieces in the archives is the only notebook he kept of his 1933 journey through Europe. This journey provided the material for his most famous books, \"A Time of Gifts,\" \"Between the Woods and the Water,\" and \"The Broken Road.\" It took the staff of the library a year to catalog thousands of documents occupying 16 meters of shelves. In addition to letters from prominent figures of the 20th century, they also discovered manuscripts, sketches, and what seems to be an unpublished poem by John Betjeman on the back of an envelope. Sir Patrick spent much of World War II in Crete, which was occupied by the Nazis. He disguised himself as a shepherd to organize guerrilla operations against the Nazis. In 1944, he carried out one of the most daring feats of the war by capturing the German commander in Crete. The 1957 film \"Ill Met by Moonlight\" is based on this operation. The film's director, George Pollock, said, \"It's the story of a colorful life of a famous writer. He was undoubtedly a superstar in his time, and his books have become even more popular over the years. The archives have already generated a lot of interest, and we are expecting it to increase among Leigh Fermor fans and those interested in the 20th century in general.\" The library is working on the digitalization of some parts of the archives so they can be accessed on the website. It also plans to organize exhibitions and presentations of the collection so that more people can see it. The archives were donated to the National Library of Scotland by the John R Murray Charitable Trust. John Murray was Leigh Fermor's publisher, and the trust also supported the cataloguing of the collection.",
