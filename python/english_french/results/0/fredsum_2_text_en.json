They mention that 80% of these young jihadists come from secular families and that the vulnerability of this youth to extremist propaganda is surprising and alarming. They propose that education and culture should create resistant youth against extremist propaganda, and that the relationship the Republic maintains through education should be reevaluated. They also discuss the importance of secularism and the separation of Church and State in preventing this type of extremism. The speaker and the other person agree on the importance of education and secularism in addressing this issue.",
