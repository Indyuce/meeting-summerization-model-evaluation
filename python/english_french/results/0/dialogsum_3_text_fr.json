P1 asks how often P2 drinks, to which P2 responds that it is only a few times per week. P1 then asks how much P2 can drink, to which P2 responds that he can usually drink 2 beers. P1 then asks if P2 is a lightweight, to which P2 responds that he is. P1 then asks how much P2 can drink, to which P2 responds that he can usually drink all night. P1 then asks if P2 spends a lot of money on drinks, to which P2 responds that he usually goes to places that offer special deals, such as the Dante's on the avenue, where he can get 10-15 dollar drinks for $15. P1 agrees and P2 suggests trying cocktails, to which P1 responds that he likes beer but has trouble drinking more than 3. P2 suggests that it will take time for P1's body to get used to it, but that it is worth working on. P2 then suggests going to the Ram Bar and Grill the next night to get a drink deal. P1 agrees.\n\nThe text appears to be a conversation between two people who are discussing their drinking habits and trying to encourage each other to drink less.",
