    "text": "\n\n\"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a novel that explores the decadence and excess of the Roaring Twenties through the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious and wealthy man who throws lavish parties in Long Island. The novel also features other characters, such as Daisy Buchanan, Tom Buchanan, and Jordan Baker, who are all connected to Gatsby in various ways.\n\nThe novel is known for its themes of love, wealth, class, and the corrupting influence of materialism. Gatsby's obsession with winning back Daisy, who is married to another man, drives much of the plot. Meanwhile, Tom Buchanan's infidelity and the shady dealings of Jordan Baker add to the novel's exploration of the darker side of the era.\n\nThe novel's prose style, characterized by its lush and evocative descriptions of the setting and characters, has made it a classic of American literature. Themes such as the American Dream and the disillusionment of the post-World War I era have also made \"The Great Gatsby\" a enduring work of fiction.",
