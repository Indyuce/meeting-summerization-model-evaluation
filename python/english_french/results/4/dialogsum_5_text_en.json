I think I lost it in a department store.\nP2: I'm afraid not, we haven't found any passports here. Have you checked with the shoe department?\nP1: Yes, I used my passport there to pay for some shoes with traveler's cheques.\nP2: I'll call the shoe department to see if they've found it. Sorry, but it hasn't turned up there either.\nP1: What should I do now?\nP2: You can fill out a lost property report and I'll keep an eye out for it. It's best to contact your embassy too, so they can issue you a new passport if it doesn't turn up.\nP1: Oh no, I seem to be losing things every time I travel!\nIn this conversation, P1 is trying to locate their lost passport after using it to pay for shoes in a department store. P2 is helpful and informative, providing support and suggestions for how to proceed.</s",
