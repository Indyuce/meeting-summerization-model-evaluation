The vaccine is especially important for people who are at high risk of serious flu complications, such as older adults, young children, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions.\nIn addition to getting vaccinated, there are other steps that can be taken to help prevent the flu, such as:\n* Practicing good hygiene, including washing your hands frequently with soap and water, and covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze\n* Avoiding close contact with people who are si",
