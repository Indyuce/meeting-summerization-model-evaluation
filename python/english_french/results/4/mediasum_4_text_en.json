    "text": "The text discusses the history and importance of Fiji Water, a bottled water brand that originates from Fiji. The company behind Fiji Water, Fiji Water Company, is based in California and has been in operation since 1996. The water is sourced from an aquifer in Fiji and is bottled and distributed globally. The text also highlights the controversy surrounding the company's tax payment in Fiji, where the government increased the tax on water extraction from one-third of a Fijian cent to 15 Fijian cents. The company initially refused to pay the higher tax, but eventually agreed to do so after the government threatened to revoke the company's rights to the water source. The text also mentions the company's owners, Lynda and Stewart Resnick, who are a wealthy California couple that own other successful businesses such as Teleflora and POM Wonderful. The text concludes by highlighting the irony of Fiji Water being a luxury product in the United States while many people in Fiji lack access to clean water.",
