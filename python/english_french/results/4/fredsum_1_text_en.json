    "text": "The conversation between GD and JB is centered around the National Front's political platform, particularly their proposal to exempt individuals under the age of 30 from income tax. GD argues that this measure would be unfair and would only benefit the wealthy, while JB defends the plan as a way to show confidence in young people and encourage entrepreneurship.\nGD questions the feasibility of the plan, pointing out that most young people who start businesses do not pay corporate taxes immediately and that the proposal is not realistic. JB responds by highlighting the plan's potential to please entrepreneurs and cut housing assistance for young people.\nGD also raises concerns about the party's taxation policies, noting that the wealthy will still be exempt from taxes under the plan, while the working classes and youth will bear the brunt of the tax burden. JB acknowledges that the party's tax choices may be seen as targeted, but argues that they are made with the goal of helping the working classes and youth of France.\nOverall, the conversation highlights the potential consequences of the National Front's tax policies and the potential for unequal distribution of the tax burden. It also underscores the importance of considering the potential impact of political decisions on different groups within society.",
