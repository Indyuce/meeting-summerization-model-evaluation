Eric Ciotti, Aurélien Pradier, and Bruno Retailleau are discussing the issue and presenting their respective parties' positions.\nEric Ciotti (EC) proposes reducing taxes as a way to boost job creation, wealth, and growth. He suggests eliminating the death tax, inheritance tax, and tax on tax, as well as reducing income tax on a few tens of percent of French people.
