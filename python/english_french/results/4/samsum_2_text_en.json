    "text": "Deirdre and Beth are having a conversation about Beth's interest in working in a beauty salon. Beth wants to try out different roles in the salon, including beauty therapy, and Deirdre is willing to give her the opportunity to do so. Deirdre mentions that the work may not be suitable for everyone, especially when it comes to tasks like waxing, but Beth is interested in giving it a try. Deirdre offers to pay Beth a small amount per session for her lunch, coffee, and bus fare, and suggests they start with a few hours of work experience on a Saturday for a couple of weeks. Beth agrees and thanks Deirdre for the opportunity.</s",
