    "text": "The text discusses the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in China and the role of structural engineers in assessing the damage and making recommendations for earthquake-resistant design. The interview features Ann Kiremidjian, a structural engineer at Stanford University who has experience assessing damage after earthquakes.\nAnn explains that the first step in assessing damage is to look at the extent of structural damage, which will be done by building experts once search-and-rescue efforts are under control. She highlights that many of the collapsed buildings in China are concrete frames with insufficient steel reinforcement, making them non-ductile and prone to collapse.\nAnn also discusses the importance of seismic codes and hazard maps in preventing earthquake damage. She explains that China has made significant progress in developing seismic codes and hazard maps since the last major earthquake, but there is still work to be done.\nAnn also talks about the process of measuring the size of the earthquake and overlaying it on a map of the region to identify areas of damage. She explains that inspectors cannot assess the damage in a reasonable amount of time, so professional structural engineers are needed to help with the inspection process.\nFinally, Ann discusses the challenges of building in an earthquake-prone area, including the need to take precautions and balance economics with safety considerations. She notes that while it may be more expensive to build in an earthquake-prone area, it is essential to prioritize safety to minimize damage and loss of life.</s",
