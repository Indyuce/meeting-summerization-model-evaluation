Simon mentions that North Korea has nuclear weapons, and Cleo expresses skepticism about the effectiveness of demonstrations in resolving complex issues. Simon argues that demonstrations can change politicians' minds and that Cleo should consider going to the demonstration as a responsible citizen.
