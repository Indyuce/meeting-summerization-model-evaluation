The group is discussing how to fulfil their project. They want to target people aged 15-35 and make a non-rechargeable battery-powered device that groups audio-visual and other functions into categories. They also want to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan. The last meeting discussed ignoring teletext and ignoring everything except the TV. The group is now discussing the next steps and how to incorporate speech recognition. They want to reach a decision on the concepts of the product and hope to have a final product in a second meeting. The group is also discussing the background information and how to incorporate it into the overall vision. They want to be innovative without adding unnecessary functional bits to the product and make it user-friendly. They also want to observe the fashion trend of fruit and vegetables in clothes and furniture.

The group discussed the design of a remote control for a home decor and computer market. They noted that the market trends are for soft and spongy materials, ergonomic and friendly to handle. They also noted that the Mac iPod is not considered high-tech as it is hard, glossy and has no buttons to hold. They suggested taking features from the Mac iPod and making it more comfortable and vibrant. They also discussed the need for a theme that unifies the design. The group also discussed the size, shape, and colour of the remote control. They noted that most remote controls are big and dark, and the buttons are not always consistent in colour. They also discussed the need for large and easy-to-press buttons and a comfortable shape.

The text describes a meeting discussing the design of a remote control. The group is considering different materials and power sources for the remote control. They are considering using rubber, titanium, plastic, wood, solar powered cells, kinetic power sources, and other components. They are also considering different shapes and sizes for the remote control, as well as different ways to power it. The group is discussing the different options and their pros and cons.


The group discussed the idea of a kinetic watch remote control and how people might not want to shake their movie controller. They also discussed the idea of incorporating fruit and vegetable shapes and colours into the product. They discussed the idea of using a bouncing ball or snowman shape and incorporating a light into the design. They also discussed the importance of the colour of the product and how it could be used as a theme to inspire the shapes and materials. They discussed the idea of having a foldable design and having volume controls inside. They also discussed the importance of incorporating the company's colour, yellow, into the design.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control. They are considering adding features such as an LCD display and speaker to make it more advanced. They also want to make it durable and easy to use. The group is also considering the placement of the buttons and the type of power source for the remote control. They are considering using a kinetic power source that would allow the remote control to be powered by the user's movements. They are also considering adding backlighting to the buttons and a clear case for the remote control.


The group was discussing the design of a new remote control. They discussed the idea of using a glowing, yellow case that is transparent and has a subtle, slightly transparent design. They also discussed the idea of using a jog dial to control the volume and channels, but they were unsure about how to incorporate this into the design. They also discussed the importance of simplicity in the design and the need to incorporate a slogan into the remote control. The group also discussed the possibility of incorporating a logo into the design.


The group discussed the materials they would use for the remote control design. They mentioned using plastic and rubber, but also suggested incorporating rubber into the case to make it more flush with the case. They also discussed the texture of the plastic, which could be textured to feel soft in the hand. The meeting was over time and the group was joking about choosing who would design the remote control.
