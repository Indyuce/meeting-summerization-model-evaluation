The group is discussing their project evaluation. They are going to evaluate the project based on four points: the room, the use of the Play-Doh, the use of the whiteboard and digital pens, and the room's institutional feel. They are going to evaluate the room as a creative space and not just a place to report ideas. They are also going to evaluate the use of the Play-Doh as a tool for creativity and the use of the whiteboard and digital pens as a tool for creativity. They are going to evaluate the room's institutional feel as a place where they can brainstorm and review ideas, but it is not a creative space.


The group discussed the concept of leadership and its impact on team members. They noted that effective leadership gives people freedom and allows for creative thought, but it can also lead to disempowering the team. The interactions are structured and the decisions have already been made, which limits the team's ability to be creative in their process. They also mentioned that the tools provided were not supportive of teamwork and that the structure of the task made it difficult for the team to communicate and collaborate. They suggested that if the task was approached differently, such as dividing the task into smaller parts and working together, it would be more conducive to teamwork.
