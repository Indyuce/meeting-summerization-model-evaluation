### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.

<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Well we will try.
<ME> Where it going?
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> That's uh strange.
<ID> What is going on?
<UI> pop-ups.
<ID> What are you What?
<ME> Hmm.
<UI> What is this, Pictionary.
<ME> Uh Mm.
<ID> Um Is a It is a It is a A duck.
<UI> Uh a bird.
<UI> Bird.
<ME> So Now save?
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> Now uh blank?
<ID> Blank, yes.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.

<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<PM> Now what.
<ID> 'Kay, hello everybody.
<ID> Uh, I guess you all know what is it about, you all received the email, I guess.
<ID> Uh, we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control.
<ID> So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project.
<ID> And uh so I'm present myself.
<ID> I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself.
<ID> So I dunno, you can starts.
<PM> Okay, so my name is Petre.
<PM> You can call me Petre, or Peter if you like.
<PM> I don't care.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Uh my name's Bob Mor.
<ID> And you are?
<ID> In the project?
<PM> Uh, in the project I'm supposed to be the technic.
<ME> Oh, sorry.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ME> So my name's Bob Morris.
<ME> I'm the Marketing Expert for this project.
<PM> Bob, okay.
<ME> Bob yeah.
<UI> My name is Hamed Getabdar, and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> So, uh, so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project, so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project.
<ID> We are talking about the project plan, and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on, and, yeah.
<ID> So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting.
<ID> Um.
<ID> So what is the goal of this project?
<ID> Is to design a new remote control.
<ID> So it should be, of course, new and original, and um it should be trendy, and user friendly.
<ID> That mean it's a very challenging project, and uh uh.
<ID> So w it's we will try to do our best, and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy.
<ID> So, um So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project?
<ID> So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Yeah and everything is will be like this.
<ID> Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project.
<ID> So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here.
<ID> So uh.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it.
<ID> Mm.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> So uh So I will ask you all to do the same.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Just to get used to the whiteboard.
<PM> So probably I would try to try to draw the animal.
<PM> Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal?
<PM> I I th I think I should.
<ID> Yeah, yeah, you can draw the picture, of course.
<ME> Yeah go ahead.
<PM> Okay, so.
<PM> Um.
<PM> Okay, American, um.
<PM> Um.
<PM> I would use the bird.
<PM> So I tried to sketch it out.
<PM> I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it, but ah.
<PM> Can you recognise it as a bird?
<PM> Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay.
<ME> Okay, okay.
<ME> So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat.
<ID> Oh.
<ME> That's its head.
<ME> Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> I dunno if I should go with this.
<ME> Thanks.
<UI> If it is enough line.
<UI> I'm sorry.
<ME> Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> I should get used to the tool, so.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Oh just wait a little bit.
<PM> C could we put it here, to make it as straight as possible?
<PM> Ah probably not.
<UI> They should be remote.
<PM> Okay, it it works like this.
<ME> Uh, that's better.
<UI> Okay, thanks.
<ME> Your lapel microphone's fallen off.
<PM> Are you left-handed?
<UI> No.
<PM> Oh, pity.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Should I clean?
<UI> Okay, I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful, so if I want to write it here, I think I can.
<ID> Never mind.
<UI> Oh.
<PM> Ah, it's maybe better if you leave it.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Maybe we should just continue.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah, don't worry about it.
<ID>, no worry.
<ME> No.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> You won't draw them, or?
<ID> You can draw it, if you want.
<UI> I dunno if I can.
<PM> Just try.
<PM> I would like to see how it looks like.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> It may be like a cow or I dunno, whatever.
<UI> I'm not good very good in drawing.
<UI> Okay, so this is very It's a bird, I think.
<UI> I dunno what is it.
<PM> No, I think it's clear.
<UI> Four.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> I'm shameful Yeah.
<ME> Oh that's good, it's good.
<PM> It's okay.
<PM> It's in it's indeed beautiful.
<ID> Good.
<ME> Yeah, and strong.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Bob.
<PM> Have to remember it.
<PM> Bob.
<ID> So good um So, let's talk about money.
<ID> Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro.
<ID> And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro.
<ID> And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world.
<ID> So n not only for Switzerland, but for the world.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> So, um.
<ID> The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro.
<PM> Per unit, I guess.
<ID> Yeah, of course.
<PM> Y oh okay.
<ID> Um, so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control, and any idea?
<ID> So, if you have some experience, good or bad, with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea.
<ID> Anything.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Well, from experience, um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small, and it's been very hard to to to use, because there's so many buttons, and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what, and the buttons are very small and very hard to press.
<ME> Um and and normally you only every use, you know, on a TV remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> Oh.
<ME> Um.
<ME> So it's frustrated me in the past, th that.
<PM> Okay, I have also some points uh.
<PM> Maybe two points.
<PM> Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light, so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room, so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery, so.
<PM> So something like this.
<PM> And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control.
<PM> But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> Ah, okay.
<ME> Okay.
<PM> You know, some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume, but something which Yeah, but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down, or or make a high volume.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Okay, n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels, or is that Yeah.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah, also if y when you take the the remote control, for example on the table, you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud, and you have a heart attack.
<PM> Ah, n.
<PM> If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream.
<PM> Yeah, f It depends what what you feel about that.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, but if you have some more notes on that.
<ID> Yeah so you can Do you have something?
<UI> Uh I Yeah, just a simple experience.
<UI> I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune.
<ID> Yeah, that's true.
<ID> Yeah without obstacles and.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Um.
<ID> Let's continue.
<ID> I have a meeting in five minutes, so maybe we should hurry.
<ME> Okay.
<PM> Okay, just a second.
<ID> Um.
<ID> So we will close uh this meeting.
<ID> So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> The So I will ask you to do some work.
<ID> Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control, start to to have new idea and read about Yeah.
<PM> Which i which is Hamed, ?
<UI> Mm.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> He's the Industrial Designer?
<ME> No, you're the Industrial Designer.
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> Uh I am the Technical Designer, I dunno which one, uh v.
<ID> Oh.
<ME> Yeah, I think that's the first.
<ID> Industry and Oh.
<UI> Uh-huh.
<ME> ID.
<ME> Industrial Designer.
<ME> And the second one is the User Interface Designer.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<PM> User Interf Okay.
<ME> And then last one's marketing, which is me.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Okay, so I'm the first one.
<ID> So, um For the User Interface Designer, which is Hamed um, uh, you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<PM> I see.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> And for the Marketing uh Manager, I dunno, okay, which is Bob, uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control.
<ID> Um, you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach.
<PM> Sign.
<ID> Yep finished.
<ID> So I see you in thirty minutes.
<ME> Great, okay.
<PM> Okay.
<UI> Okay, thanks.
<ME> Thanks guys.
<ME> Bye.
<UI> Bye.
<ID> Thank you.
<PM> Uh.

### Assistant: The meeting was about designing a remote control. The goal is to be original, trendy and user-friendly. The goal is to sell the remote for twenty-euro. The expected profit is around fifty million-euro. The goal is to have a market around the world. The idea is to start today to have idea what we want to do what we experiment with remote controls, and any idea. If you have experience with remote controls you can share your idea. The second point is that current remote controls there is no back light, if you are playing with in the dark room it's probably worth to have something like back light. And the second point from me would be that normal remote controls there are two buttons for volume control.
