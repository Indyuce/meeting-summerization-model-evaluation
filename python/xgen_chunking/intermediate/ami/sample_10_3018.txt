### Human: Summarize the following text.

<UI> Uh, making a profit of fifty million Euros.
<ID> Alright so twenty five.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> So, it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy.
<ID> So yeah, I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television, and they're fairly basic.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So uh Mm.
<UI> Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're, yeah.
<ME> Yeah the universal ones.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> So presumably that might be an idea to put into.
<ID> But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features.
<PM> Slim.
<ID> For sure.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<UI> Uh 'cause I mean, what uh twenty five Euros, that's about I dunno, fifteen Pounds or so?
<ME> Mm-hmm, it's about that.
<UI> And that's quite a lot for a remote control.
<ID> Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black.
<ME> As you said they come with the TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions, so maybe we could think about colour?
<UI> Uh-huh.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least.
<ME> Um, and as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick, so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know those things?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> The the keyrings, yeah yeah.
<ME> Because we always lose our remote control.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Okay, that's cool.
<PM> Uh yeah uh, being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market?
<PM> What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices?
<PM> What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> So before deciding or before finalising this project, we must discuss all these things, like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also, because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP three player like any electronic devices.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands, so, yes, all this.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ID> Uh, what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this?
<UI> So, we're looking for 'Kay.
<UI> We're Sorry, carry on.
<ID> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it, or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Then you lose it, yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Kind of um, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like, 'cause Yeah.
<UI> For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty.
<ME> No, I wasn't, no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a PDA but Okay.
<UI> Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh, oh actually, no, we'll allocate.
<UI> So you do the looking around at other remote controls.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Um, if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever, and you could look into um basically how how it's made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.
<UI> And obviously, other instructions will come from the personal coach.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive.
<ME> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said?
<ME> Yep.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And you look at competition and design.
<PM> Yep.
<UI> Cool.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> So we have uh Um.
<ID> Wait for emails?
<PM> Uh.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Okay, groovy.
<UI> And no doubt we'll get um Sorry.
<ME> Oh no, .
<ME> Sorry it's okay.
<UI> We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> I shall I can't imagine these are worth much.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Fashion into electronic.
<UI> Okay.

### Assistant: The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes, the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors, and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So welcome.
<ID> The first kick-off meeting.
<ID> What shall we do?
<ID> First the opening, then the rest.
<ID> What are we going to do.
<ID> We m have to make a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy and user-friendly.
<ID> So we will get back th on that.
<ID> First we have to make a functional design.
<ID> After that we have to make a conceptual design, and then after that a detailed design.
<ID> So we'll discuss that later.
<ID> First we have a look at.
<ID> So first to we have to make a small painting.
<ID> What have do we have to do.
<ID> First you can save the documents.
<ID> We have to do that every time we make something.
<ID> You can print it.
<ID> No.
<ID> And we have to use the pen and the eraser.
<ID> So Now.
<ID> We all have to use this one.
<ID> You have to make your own favourite animal.
<ID> So I'll make an example.
<ME> Yep.
<ID> First don't touch that things.
<ID> You can use the pen.
<ID> And then you can make um something.
<UI> Nice.
<ID> Um you can change some things.
<ID> Um format, line, and change it.
<ID> And you can change the colour.
<UI> An elephant.
<ID> So that's it.
<ID> So So and after it you have to save it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Now we can make a new one.
<ID> You have to paint now.
<ME> Oh.
<ID> So you're next.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Well we will try.
<ME> Where it going?
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> That's uh strange.
<ID> What is going on?
<UI> pop-ups.
<ID> What are you What?
<ME> Hmm.
<UI> What is this, Pictionary.
<ME> Uh Mm.
<ID> Um Is a It is a It is a A duck.
<UI> Uh a bird.
<UI> Bird.
<ME> So Now save?
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> Now uh blank?
<ID> Blank, yes.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay next one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Let's try this.
<UI> Whoo.
<PM> Uh Um.
<ME> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Mm.
<UI> Oh not.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Oh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> No problem.
<UI> Shit happens.
<ME> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> A parrot.
<ME> Wow.
<UI> Ish.
<ME> Oh.
<UI> He did it before.
<PM> Uh No, no.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Nice.
<UI> Oh.
<ID> Very good.
<PM> Uh blank.
<UI> Thank you.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Very good.
<ID> So um you can always go back.
<ID> So That's it.
<ID> So that was two.
<ID> Now next.
<ID> The budget.
<ID> The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.
<ID> And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it.
<ID> So now we have to think about what we will make.
<ID> First I wanna hear from you.
<ID> Uh what are your experiences with remote controls.
<ID> So F first.
<UI> Uh I will start.
<UI> Uh Big one, they are uh not easy to use.
<UI> Um I have one set and uh a remote control, when I dropped it, uh it broke.
<UI> So that won't be uh our goal, I think.
<PM> No.
<UI> And uh g big buttons, m uh that's easier to use than uh I think.
<UI> Not all the small buttons, you don't know Big buttons, positive.
<ID> Is this positive or negative, that uh big buttons?
<ID> Positive.
<UI> All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control, you won't know what they're working for.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> What are your experiences?
<PM> Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the TV set.
<PM> And that it controls the channels and the the volume.
<ID> Mm.
<PM> And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote.
<PM> So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it.
<PM> And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light, and uh and you see that it's working.
<PM> And uh yeah.
<PM> Uh Yeah, but No no no.
<ID> So and do they always have that?
<PM> But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that.
<ID> It's easy to you.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ME> Uh at home we have a TV, a video uh recorder, a DVD player, and a satellite receiver.
<ME> We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> That's not really ea easy.
<UI> Help also.
<ME> So it would be nice if we have one for all.
<UI> Thank you.
<ME> And we also had a remote control for our radio set.
<ME> But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it, and you didn't know which one was what.
<ME> And it was uh uh v not easy to use.
<ME> So we n barely used it.
<ID> Okay so they have too much.
<ID> So next.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.
<ID> So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control?
<ID> What what does it have to have?
<UI> The weight.
<UI> Not not too heavy.
<ID> Not too heavy.
<UI> Not much buttons.
<ID> Yes.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> Bust-free.
<UI> That when you drop it, it won't break.
<UI> Like uh some kind of rubber on it.
<UI> Or hard uh hard plastic.
<UI> Uh buttons not too small.
<UI> Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control, sometimes it happen.
<ID> Yes.
<UI> Uh it between the couch and you can't find it.
<UI> When you push a but a button on the TV, then you hear some uh some sort of bleep.
<ID> Like a phone.
<UI> And then you uh, hey there there's remote control.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So, that's.
<UI> Next.
<PM> Yeah well that's that are good ideas.
<PM> Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner, that that indicates that it's working.
<PM> If you push a button.
<PM> Um Yeah.
<PM> And looking on the budget, not too expensive uh material.
<PM> So probably plastic or something.
<PM> Uh Mm no.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view, it also has to look nice.
<ME> Or you won't sell it.
<ID> Yes.
<ME> And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have.
<ME> And it should work with as many uh as possible of them.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is It has to be compatible with other things.
<ME> Yes.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> I have one more idea.
<UI> Just popped up.
<ID> Yes?
<UI> Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries.
<UI> So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks.
<ID> No battery use.
<ID> So more ideas?
<ID> No okay.
<ID> It's only the first ideas.
<ID> So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour.
<ID> Uh Okay.
<ID> Next meeting, half an hour.
<ID> Um, what you have to do.
<ID> Well look on your.
<ID> And Next instructions you'll get in your email.
<ID> So This is the first meeting.
<ID> See you later in half an hour.
<PM> Yes.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Thank you.

### Assistant: For the first meeting, the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls, including ease of use, multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable, for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries.

### Human: Summarize the following text.

<ID> So we can start?
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Suppose I have to do my presentation.
<UI> Ah okay.
<ID> Eh um So, I'll present myself, I'm Ada Longmund, and as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager.
<UI> It's Ada Longmund?
<ID> So um we will have to um speak about m the project.
<ID> Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control, so the remote control has to be original, trendy and um user-friendly.
<ID> Record.
<ID> So the project method is the following.
<ID> So if we're um the functional design, you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other.
<ID> Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> The tool training is to try out the white board, so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard, yeah?
<ME> So right now?
<ID> I don't know if we have to do it now, maybe later later.
<PM> So yeah I think you can do it.
<UI> Yeah, I don't know.
<ID> So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros.
<PM> Twenty five Euros?
<ME> Mm.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> I think it's quite good price, yeah.
<UI> I it's it's reasonable, s quite yeah.
<ME> It's reasonable, I think, yeah.
<UI> Twenty five.
<ID> And uh it will uh be a an international remote control, as we want to sell it in the entire world, and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes.
<UI> Is Yeah.
<ID> So, as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control.
<ID> Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls, try to create something new and people would like to to buy.
<ID> And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes, so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do.
<ID> And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications.
<UI> I I hope so ID is for the Industrial Design, yeah?
<ME> Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think.
<PM> Yep.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> AMI and okay.
<ID> ID, yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> So So I will manage all all the group.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> And UID, it's for the User Interface Designer, yeah?
<PM> That's me.
<ME> Okay, and Marketing Expert, it's me.
<UI> AMI yeah project.
<UI> you will be the manager yeah.
<ME> You can manage all this, yeah.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Good.
<ID> So you have questions?
<ME> Um.
<ME> Not really.
<ID> So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> So which you, the Industrial Designer.
<PM> No I'm user interf I'm user interface design.
<UI> I am the Industrial Design, yeah I am the Industrial Designer so.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And you?
<ID> Mm okay.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design?
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> I mean, you have to know.
<ME> Ah, you have to know it.
<UI> It's difficult.
<ME> It's your job, so I hope you you know what it is.
<UI> You know very soon.
<PM> Yeah, I think so.
<UI> So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design, it is how the object will look like.
<ME> Mm.
<ID> I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it.
<PM> Okay, so I make uh u user interface.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it.
<ID> And i maybe you will transform it.
<PM> Make make yeah.
<PM> Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh, it's the function design.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> So the materi Okay right.
<PM> I design the user f user interface, you design the function.
<ID> Maybe, it is the outside and the inside.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<PM> Okay.
<UI> But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know.
<PM> Yeah yeah.
<UI> But I don't know.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Well.
<ME> You know.
<UI> I'm the industrial designer.
<ME> Oh, okay, okay.
<ME> Not the other one.
<UI> So.
<PM> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay.
<ME> Yeah, I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer.
<ID> And yeah.
<ID> And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> So you don't have to do something really specific, as everybody everybody will have to use it, it's sor the same as keyboards.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Mm.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> You know, you have Qwerty, Azerty, French and UK keyboard, so really the remote control to be international.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> And not too expensive.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> And uh simple.
<ID> As we want to maximise the benefit.
<PM> And easy to use.
<ME> And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty, so.
<ID> Yeah, you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros.
<PM> Ah, yeah.
<ME> That's the problem.
<UI> It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, I don't know.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> So, is it okay?
<ME> Mm.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> It's clear.
<ME> Yeah, maybe should go and draw an animal.
<UI> Is it?
<UI> Are we supposed to do right now?
<PM> Yeah yeah, you try.
<PM> Try first.
<UI> Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now.
<ID> So you think we have to do it now?
<PM> You can draw something which is very simple.
<UI> Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it, so.
<ID> You want me to draw something?
<ID> Product manager okay, let's go, I will try.
<PM> Oh, maybe we should bring Kemy here.
<PM> Kemy is really good at drawing.
<ME> Many Yeah.
<UI> It's not matter So.
<PM> You're going to draw?
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Uh it's the same as mine.
<UI> yeah.
<UI> It's a It's a cat.
<PM> What's this?
<PM> It's a fat cat.
<UI> It is not a fat cat.
<ME> It's the fat cat, okay.
<UI> Yeah, it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat.
