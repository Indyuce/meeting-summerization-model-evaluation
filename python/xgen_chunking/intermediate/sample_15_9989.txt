The group is discussing the design of a TV remote control. They have decided on the energy source, which can be a battery, hand dynamo, kinetic provision of energy, or solar cells. They have also discussed the case material, which can be plastic, latex, rubber, wood, or titanium. The group has also discussed the push-buttons, which can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheel, and the display. They have also discussed the shape of the remote control, with ideas including a flat one, a curved one, or a double curved one. The group is also considering the weight of the remote control and the possibility of having a rubber case with push-buttons.

The group is also discussing the possibility of using a rubber case for the remote control, with the idea of using rubber push-buttons and a rubber double curved case. They are also considering the display and the type of energy source. The group is also discussing the budget for the project and the possibility of using a kinetic provision of energy.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a coffee machine. They are considering different features such as energy source (battery or external power supply), case material (flat, curved, or double curved rubber), and push-buttons (simple or advanced with infra-red sender). They also discuss the possibility of using a sample sensor for voice recognition, but ultimately decide against it. The group decides to go with a flat, rubber, double curved case and simple push-buttons.

### Assistant: The text is a summary of a group discussion about the design of a remote control for a coffee machine. The group is considering different features such as energy source, case material, and push-buttons. They also discuss the possibility of using a sample sensor for voice recognition, but ultimately decide against it. The group decides to go with a flat, rubber, double curved case and simple push-buttons.


The group discussed the design of a remote control. They discussed the need for a simple and straightforward design, with a limited number of buttons and a power button. The buttons should be easy to press and have a clear indication of which button is being pressed. They also discussed the need for a durable and anti-RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) rubber button cover to prevent RSI from occurring. The group also discussed the need for a clear power button and a numerical keypad. The design should be simple and not too busy or gaudy. The group also discussed the need for a way to burn off steam, which could be achieved by having a button that can be pressed to play a sound or light up.

The group also discussed the user interface of the remote control. They discussed the need for a simple and straightforward layout, with clear and easy-to-read buttons. The buttons should be easy to press and have a clear indication of which button is being pressed.

The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a television. They are considering adding a button that prevents other buttons from operating, as well as making it visually appealing and technologically innovative. They have decided to use a rubber case as it prevents the remote from being damaged and it can be thrown around without affecting the battery life. They also want to make sure that the remote is easy to use and can be used to charge other electronics.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They are considering making it easy to use, stylish, and different from current remote controls. They also want to incorporate the idea of using spongy, rubber keys that can be squeezed to charge the batteries and have different coloured buttons. They also want to incorporate the idea of having fruit and vegetable shaped buttons. The group is considering different colours and materials for the remote control, and they want to make sure that it is not too flashy or too plain. They also want to make sure that it is not too expensive to make.

The group is also considering the image of the remote control. They want to make sure that it is not too similar to current remote controls, but they are not sure what the image should be. They want to make sure that the remote control is different and unique.


The group discussed their roles for the next meeting, where they will work together to create a new remote control. They will be responsible for designing the look and feel, user interface, and physical ideas. They will also evaluate the product and work with the bosses to field more information. The remote control will be simple, with rubber casing and no new technological chips or expensive printing. The group will also look into adding a lock key facility. The pay-raise will be based on the success of the product and profit sharing will be considered. The group discussed the importance of making the remote control stand out and be immediately noticeable.
