The meeting is a conceptual design meeting for a remote control. The team is discussing the design of the remote control and its features. They want it to be fashionable and easy to use, with large, easy-to-read buttons and a clear colour scheme. They also want it to be technologically innovative and have a soft, spongy feel. The team also wants to promote the product and appeal to the older generation with a retro design. The team is also discussing the interface concept and the possibilities of where they can go with the remote control. They are considering using the iPod's simplistic menu section with round buttons and the ability to use it by feel as well as by sight.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They are considering two options: using raised buttons or buttons with a specific shape. They also want to make the remote control durable and easy to use. They are considering using a specific shape for the buttons, such as a triangle or round shape. They also want to change the colour of the remote control to yellow with the company logo. They are also considering making the remote control programmable for children, so that they can only watch certain channels. The group is also discussing the materials needed for the basic internal construction of the remote control, including rubber for the buttons, aluminium for the battery contacts, and an integrated circuit with a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitor. They are also considering using solar cells or kinetic power as an alternative to batteries. The group is also discussing the options for the casing, including straight, curved, or double-curved shapes. They are also considering using different materials for the casing, such as plastic, rubber, titanium, or wood. The group is also considering using a simple chip for the push button function and a more complicated chip for the scroll function. They are also discussing the possibility of using a sample sensor or speaker chip from the manufacturing division.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They are considering different options for the remote, such as a rubber-coated wooden remote, a double-curved wooden remote, a remote with a voice recognition feature, and a base for the remote to charge the batteries. They are also considering the size and weight of the remote and the type of energy source it should have. They are considering the cost of producing the remote and the chip that will control it. They are also considering the type of material the remote should be made of. The group is divided on the design of the remote and is considering different options.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They are considering using titanium for the chip, but it would be more expensive than using plastic. They are also considering producing a high-end version with a rarity element and selling the basic version for 25 euros. They are considering using a soft latex cover for the base and a hard plastic for the top face. They are also considering using a specific code for when the remote is lost and a tracker for when it is found. They are considering using a key-phrase instead of voice activation for the remote. They are also considering using a mid-class chip for the remote. They are considering using a double A or triple A battery for the remote. They are also considering using a key finder instead of a voice activated remote. They are considering using a key-phrase instead of voice activation for the remote. They are also considering using a mid-class chip for the remote. They are considering using a double A or triple A battery for the remote.

The group was discussing the design of a remote control. They were considering the shape and placement of buttons, as well as the material used for the remote control. They also discussed the idea of having a logo on the remote control and the possibility of using a cover for the buttons. They also discussed the color of the remote control and the idea of using a yellow strip at the bottom with the company logo. They also discussed the idea of using a silver or metallic-looking cover for the buttons.

The group also discussed the budget for the project and the idea of making the remote control durable, with a device to help find it if lost, and not using too many batteries. They also discussed the idea of having scroll buttons on the side and buttons on top, with the buttons being labelled. They also discussed the idea of using a different colour for the remote control, and the possibility of having a logo on the button.


The group discussed the design of the remote control and agreed on the use of blue and yellow for the touch buttons. They also discussed the illumination of the yellow buttons and agreed on the idea of using yellow illumination. The group also discussed the inclusion of other buttons and agreed that they would all be included in the final design. The group also discussed the user interface design and agreed on the roles of the ID and UID. The group also agreed on the prototype design using modelling clay. The group also agreed on the email to be sent to all members.

The meeting was productive and productive.
