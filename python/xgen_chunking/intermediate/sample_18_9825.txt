The meeting is a functional design meeting for a remote control. The agenda includes discussing user requirements, functions, and working design. The group will go in the order that they presented earlier. The group discussed the user research done by Real Reaction, which found that people want a fancier looking remote, and that they would pay more for it. They also found that people are frustrated with losing their remotes, and that they would like the remote to be easy to use. The group will consider the needs and desires of the user when designing the remote control.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a television. They are considering what the remote should look like and what functions it should have. They are considering the importance of aesthetics and how it should be easy to use. They are also considering the budget and what materials they will use to make the remote. They are planning to use a user interface design process to come up with different prototypes and get feedback from users to see what works and what doesn't. They are also considering the balance between features and price. They are looking at examples of existing remote controls to see what works and what doesn't and to find a balance between the two.


The text describes a working design presentation for a remote control. The design process involves breaking down the elements to make the remote control function, and converting the energy into practical use. The user interface is crucial in this process, and the energy source, user interface, and infra-red bulb are the main components. The user controls the chip, and the chip controls the switch. The infra-red bulb sends data to the receiver. The energy source should be long-lasting, the chip should work well with the user interface, and the infra-red signal should be reliable and clear. The group also discussed teletext, which is a British thing similar to a basic web browser.


The text describes a meeting where the participants are discussing the design of a remote control for a television. The remote control will have a yellow and black colour scheme and will feature the brand name "Fashion in Electronics". The group also wants to include a voice activation feature but it is not clear if it will be included in the final product. The target audience is likely to be young people with disposable income who are interested in technology. The group also wants to make sure the remote control is easy to use and simple.

The text does not mention any specific details about the technical features of the remote control, such as whether it will have LED indicators, buttons, or any other features.


The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a television. They are aiming for simplicity and fashion in the design. They want the remote to be easy to use, with a main button section and additional buttons that can be pulled out for more advanced functions. They also want the remote to be durable and have a feature to help locate it if it is lost. The group is considering adding a button to the remote that will play a sound to help locate it. They also want to make sure that the infrared technology is functional and of high quality. They are targeting a demographic of people who own a television and who have recently purchased it. They are considering defining the target group based on income rather than age as different people may appeal to different age groups but have similar income levels.


The group discussed the functions of a remote control and how to make it easy to use and fashionable. They also discussed the battery usage and charging options. They concluded the meeting by discussing the space in living rooms and individual actions. The next meeting will include individual work, a questionnaire, and lunch break. The group will also receive specific instructions from their personal coach.
