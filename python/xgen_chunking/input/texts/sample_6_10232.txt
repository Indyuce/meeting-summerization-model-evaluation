<UI> Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you, however, um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um are a bit uh well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> So the all in one idea goes out the window.
<UI> And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four, um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> So um, presentations, were you anybody got, raring to go?
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Raring to go?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Good stuff.
<UI> Mm.
<PM> Um.
<UI> Oh I need to plug you in.
<PM> So how S Sh do you want me to hold it?
<ME> Wow.
<UI> Just about.
<ID> It's a inspired design.
<UI> Uh there we go, just screw 'em on in.
<UI> Gonna have to swap them round so now, it was function F eight.
<PM> So, after that?
<PM> F eight.
<UI> That's the wee blue one.
<PM> f oh sorry F eight.
<UI> Blue one F eight.
<UI> Should do it, good one.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Uh, me again, Rajan the Marketing Expert.
<PM> Uh, as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out, sorry, yeah sure.
<UI> Hold on, sorry.
<UI> and if you just click that it'll go ahead, one at a time.
<PM> Yeah, yeah.
<PM> Uh actually, sorry I have to see the other, sorry.
<UI> Sorry, uh.
<PM> Yeah, thank you.
<PM> Uh, yes, I have to look at the uh market potential for this product, uh, like consumer likings and everything, what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not?
<PM> Then Sorry.
<UI> P press F five to start it first.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah, I can, okay.
<ID> Hmm.
<UI> Jesus.
<PM> Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey.
<PM> A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings, what they prefer what they not prefer, w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things.
<PM> And what we got was, we found that if you uh, what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market.
<PM> Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly.
<PM> They are not so good looking.
<PM> So, we have to put stress on this, uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design, uh should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers.
<PM> And yes that's wi uh this will definitely, this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales.
<PM> Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also.
<PM> So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros, which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls.
<UI> Excellent.
<PM> Then And the second thing, some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls, but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated.
<PM> Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it.
<PM> Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things.
<PM> So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also.
<PM> So we have to take care of this fact also.
<PM> Then.
<PM> Uh it was function I want to go to.
<UI> Oh you wanna go back?
<UI> Just escape.
<PM> Uh, escape, okay thank you.
<PM> Then if we look at this slide, uh these are in your shared documents, you can see, like Uh, sorry.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> So, sorry I was just gonna say, what was the question for this?
<ME> Or is are you coming on to that?
<PM> Ah t look all the market potential, what uh how we should design consu our remote controls, what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit, enhance our sales.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> So these percentages are are what?
<PM> Yeah, these are different age group persons like uh sorry, I can open it in another way.
<UI> Okay.
<PM> Uh, yes.
<UI> Speech recognition.
<PM> If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point, like for speech recognition in a remote control.
<PM> So we can emphasise on this point also like, because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five, and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh TV are belong to this age group.
<ME> Hmm.
<UI> Hmm.
<PM> So we should look Yeah.
<UI> We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well.
<PM> We can look at that that factor also, so yes.
<UI> Uh, which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual, sort of.
<ME> Mm, mm.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> So, and And then Yes.
<UI> Fifteen to twe Okay.
<PM> I think so.
<PM> Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market.
<PM> They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control.
<PM> So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn.
<PM> They need not to have any, much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales.
<PM> So um this is all about uh market potential by me.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Uh, yes, th thank you.
<UI> Okay, thank you.
<UI> Um, follow on with Helen?
<UI> Yeah please.
<ME> Yep, sure, that's cool, um Yeah.
<PM> Yeah we have to take that out.
<UI> Oh, so we do yeah.
<PM> Sorry.
<UI> Fun and games.
<PM> Sorry.
<UI> Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough.
<PM> Uh sorry, I have.
<UI> I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well.
<PM> Brian, this one also I.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay.
<PM> Thank you very much Brian.
<PM> If you want me to help, yeah.
<ME> Um, yep.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Okay, and then what do I press, F eight?
<PM> Uh F eight.
<UI> Function F eight.
<PM> Function F eight.
<ME> Oh right.
<PM> Mm s.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<PM> It's not coming.
<ME> Oh.
<PM> Function F eight, okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> No signal.
<UI> Hmm.
<PM> Computer.
<UI> There you go.
<PM> Computer adjusting, yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Cool.
<ME> Okay and then how do I press the the big one, to get it on to the big F five and I press that again to get it off as well do I?
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Uh F five.
<UI> Um, F five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing.
<PM> Escape.
<ME> Okay, so um I'm the interface design designer, User Interface Designer sorry, uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto, put the fashion in electronics, so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable, it's a big concern of ours.
<ME> Okay, and how do I press n just the next button?
<UI> Uh just a left uh left mouse button.
<ME> The arrow?
<ME> Okay.
<ME> So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like, what people dislike.
<ME> Um and what people fashionable, because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our TV I think.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> So um what they like and what they find fashionable.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> And ergonomics, we said um, I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself, but um maybe that comes up, I don't know.
<UI> That can come under Arlo as well.
<ME> And the findings, well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set.
<ME> That's what people want to do.
<UI> Uh.
<ME> Um, so they need to be included, um, but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones.
<ME> I don't know how to get to them, do I press F five is it?
<UI> Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar.
<ME> escape?
<ME> Oh okay, cool.
<ME> I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one.
<ME> These are two leading um remote controls at the moment.
<UI> Uh okay.
<ME> You know they're grey, they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons, it's hard to tell from here what they actually do, and they don't look very exciting at all.
<UI> 'Kay.
<ME> Um, personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use, it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff, um, but there you go, that's what we're up against, and I think we can do much better than that.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Of course.
<ME> Um hang on.
<UI> We hope so.
<ME> F five, okay, sorry.
<ME> Personal preferences.
<ME> Um, well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important, um Uh-huh.
<UI> Yeah, particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about RSI and things as well.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> And um I thought not too edgy and like a box, more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and or organic, yeah, more organic shape I think.
<UI> Organic.
<ME> Um simple designs, like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out, only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons, so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Sales, .
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Um, hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because TFT have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen, anyway, so um Yeah, no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for TV but as you pointed out people don't actually want that, so maybe we forget about that.
<UI> Yeah it's like a, yeah.
<UI> It's.
<UI> Right.
<UI> And also the company want to keep it stuck to the TV for uh to keep down the production time.
<PM> Yeah.
<ME> It's for one TV oh right okay, sure.
<ME> And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like glow-in-the-dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Exactly.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Easy finder with the a whistle function or something, or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> And I think that, yep, that's it.
<UI> That's cool.
<ID> So uh, I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling, and uh I was just curious to know, have we done any research into how many people can whistle?
<ME> Okay?
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Um, or if is that a function we want in the remote?
<ME> Um, I haven't been able to Mm-hmm, yeah or some sort of voice Yeah.
<UI> Um, do you have trouble whistling?
<ID> I don't, but I I know a lot of people do right.
<UI> Really?
<UI> Ooh.
<ID> Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too, right?
<UI> Yeah, I suppose that's true.
<UI> Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just, you know, where are you?
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> That's costly though.
<ID> Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um, shouting, you know, uh and then, what would the response be?
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Hmm.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> Sounds good.
<ID> It beeps back at you or something?
<ME> Yeah, something.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Well, uh let me set this up.
<ID> So I plug it in, press F five?
<ID> Function F five?
<UI> Function F eight for the um the uh Yeah.
<ID> Or function F eight?
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> I think it's uh just to lock it in.
<ID> It's got it.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Um.
<ID> So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys, um so it's good you went first, and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others.
<UI> Alright.
<UI> Let's remember that.
<ID> Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products, and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour.
<ID> Um, a lot of the buttons aren't used, and uh he mentioned that they're not fun to use.
<ID> And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote, there could be a little microphone on it, and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<UI> But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Oh yeah, yeah, that's true.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes.
<ID> Um.
<UI> Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there.
<ID> Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um, and then as for the user interface it should be trendy, um and not computery, right, so more low tech and not too many buttons.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss.
<ID> Right um, and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window.
<ID> And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before, which include, you know, um space craft, coffee makers, and bullet trains Or uh or a high speed train.
<UI> Ah is that what that is?
<ID> Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these.
<UI> Well that's cool.
<UI> If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control, yeah.
<ID> Right.
<ME> Yeah sure.
<ID> So, I figured, just put 'em all together.
<ID> You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your TV, and um as for the user interface problem, you know, too many buttons.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> Give it one button and and it's a you know, for the the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a Right.
<UI> Right okay.
<ME> Well I like that design.
<UI> Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated, is it?
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> So I think I I missed the budget thing, it was fifty million Euros?
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> And we gotta sell twenty five of them?
<ME> Yeah, not a problem.
<ID> Right.
<PM> Fifty million was uh prof As a profit.
<ID> Okay.
<UI> Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit, so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time.
<ID> Oh okay, so I I mixed those numbers.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Well I guess more realistically then, we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing, cheap plastic uh, you know, um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um, we don't wanna have it Uh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea?
<UI> Is that is that gonna mark up a lot?
<ME> Or a little base station or something, .
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Yeah, yeah, we could do that too.
<ID> Um, I hadn't thought of that.
<ID> Yeah.
<ME> That might cost more though, 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide, well we provide the first batteries, but it's more, it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries.
<UI> Yeah, yeah.
<ID> Right.
<UI> I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it, so I don't think it'd up up the price that much.
<ME> A battery in it, kinda.
<ID> Right, so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons, but since we're a cutting edge company, we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition, whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh, just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about.
<UI> Okay.
<ID> Um so here's you know, a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me.
<ID> Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that.
<ID> And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences, I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory, uh non volatile memory, just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options.
<PM> Yeah, me too.
<ID> Oh okay.
<ID> And the uh, the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know, they take more budgeting, um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles.
<UI> Right.
<ME> Mm 'kay.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> That's all I got.
<UI> 'Kay, thank you very much, um I'll take that back.
<ID> Ooh that's tight.
<UI> Right, also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting, so didn't manage to forward it on to you, it is let's see, I'll find it myself, um Ta nah.
<ID> Okay, I don't think we need to screw it in.
<ID> Just push it.
<PM> Yeah.
<UI> We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated, and everybody uses the internet anyway.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Um, dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind.
<UI> Um it's only for the television, which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television, and um instead of colours and sorta colour options, they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Corporate colour.
<UI> Yellow.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Yellow.
<UI> I presume.
<UI> Um, everything, all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean, I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Uh, where am I?
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Okay, so, we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have.
<ME> 'Kay.
<UI> Uh, now, we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> We'll use the the basic functions for a television.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> No teletext.
<UI> Um okay hold on.
<ME> Although the the danger with that is, it could look a bit cheap.
<UI> Not enough buttons you mean?
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Well Mm.
<UI> So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um I do however have this from over my head, that they don't want teletext on it.
<ME> On the number of buttons, kind of functions and stuff.
<ME> Mm-hmm, okay.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<UI> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that, or maybe they'll send some information about that, about um what people, whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control.
<PM> About cost.
<PM> Okay.
<UI> Okay um.
<UI> So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick.
<ID> Yeah yeah.
<UI> Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a TFT display, interactive display.
<UI> However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um said people didn't like.
<ME> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
<UI> Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already, sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever, I think maybe that's a bit, going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons, and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons, so it sorta keeps it simple.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Um glow in the dark, is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material?
<ME> Um Glow in the dark material I was thinking.
<PM> Uh.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> So Yeah.
<ME> Um, so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think.
<PM> I Uh may I say something about?
<UI> Yeah.
<PM> Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote, in the room.
<PM> But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time.
<ME> Often lost s was that, yeah.
<UI> Lost, yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control, like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<PM> Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control, and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales, so we should take it into consideration also.
<UI> That's cool.
<ME> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
<UI> That's cool.
<UI> Okay, cool.
<UI> Um speech recognition I take it I don't, I've I know of no products um that use speech recognition well.
<ID> Well hmm.
<ID> Oh it's They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it.
<ID> You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh BBC one and it goes to that channel.
<UI> Really?
<ID> Yeah, it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem.
<ME> Mm.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to BBC one.
<UI> Yeah, or a yeah an advert an advert for BBC two on BBC one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing.
<ID> Right, right, and so there was a lot of this, you'd be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something, but if you can work around that that noise problem Right.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Mm.
<ME> 'Kay.
<UI> Uh-huh.
<ME> Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually, but what about um something that's built into the TV um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep.
<UI> Ah, that's a good idea.
<UI> So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly.
<ME> If you find if y Yeah.
<ID> Right and then it would do just you know, uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise.
<ID> What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the TV speaker, or not a remo I'm sorry, a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote, 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their TVs.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Yeah, that's the only thing, yeah.
<ID> But yeah, then you have like the little se separate module by the TV speaker which Right, and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television.
<UI> Right.
<UI> That we should just stick on, yeah.
<ME> That comes with our remote control.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> And that's a sort of basic RF kind of frequency so it'll be cheap.
<ID> Right, right.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Right, right.
<ID> Um.
<ID> Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again.
<ID> If you do have this sorta speech interface to it, you don't even need to find it.
<ID> You just say you know, um whatever you whatever you want the remote for, you know to change the channel or to uh turn the TV on and off, you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know, within hearing range.
<UI> Uh-huh.
<ID> And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job.
<ME> That could also be built into the TV though, which might make our remote control a bit obsolete.
<UI> Yeah.
<ID> Well, hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve.
<UI> It might do us out of a job.
<ME> Yeah, okay.
<UI> Um Okay.
<UI> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing.
<UI> Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that, so I th yeah and expense and the time.
<ME> Mm.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> And the expense.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen.
<ME> Mm.
<UI> Um, but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem.
<UI> Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material?
<UI> Is that Contrast contra well.
<ID> Um.
<ME> Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour.
<ID> Mm.
<ID> Yeah, no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know, and then uh if you're, if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Yeah, okay.
<UI> So if it's dow it's d uh yeah.
<UI> Or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine.
<ID> Right.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Right.
<UI> Um Okay, well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially, um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well, bright yellow logo in our our um slogan.
<ME> Yeah, 'cause what I thought, main Slogan, yeah.
<UI> Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway, and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness.
<ME> Right.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<ME> 'Cause yeah, that w more than finding it, that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark, you can um still see the remote control.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Alright, so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback, sort of remote finder, then that kinda stuffs that one out then.
<ME> That was more of a a gimmick.
<UI> Do you think?
<ME> Mm.
<UI> Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then.
<ME> Yeah, unnecessary.
<UI> Okay.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> Um, okay so scratch that.
<UI> Uh so we've got do we want to go with the TFT idea or the is that far too expensive?
<ID> Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now, I I think Yeah.
<UI> Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself.
<UI> Um Mm-hmm.
<ID> Well, I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot, you know they get thrown around, there's a good chance the the TFT screen would break or uh get damaged.
<ME> Mm.
<ID> They're pretty fragile.
<ME> So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a TFT screen?
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Um no, I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess.
<UI> Um Uh So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have.
<UI> Um.
<UI> So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff, um Uh you were finding out about teletext.
<ID> Yeah mm.
<UI> If you could find out that uh Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive, no?
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Totally, it takes cheap speech recognition, she they wi Yeah.
<ID> Oh.
<ME> Yeah you think so?
<ID> Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the TFT, it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits.
<UI> Oh right, okay.
<UI> Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right, okay.
<ID> And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system, like a Okay.
<UI> Uh well that kind of takes back the RF the RF remote sort of idea as well.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> Um.
<UI> Five minutes.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> Decisions.
<UI> Uh, votes, let's vote.
<UI> Who wants TFT?
<UI> No-one does.
<UI> Excellent, so we'll go with speech recognition, yeah?
<ME> Mm-hmm, that's cool.
<UI> Um, speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design.
<ME> Um if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick.
<UI> And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head, programmability.
<PM> Glow in dark.
<UI> Uh Uh o okay.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> And also, integrating the, remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan.
<ME> Mm-hmm.
<UI> Okay, so.
<UI> Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well.
<UI> So, it just helps me summarize them.
<ID> Yeah yeah.
<PM> Here?
<PM> Sure.
<UI> And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway, so uh Uh pro uh project documents.
<ME> And where is it sorry?
<UI> On AMI scenario controller.
<ID> So it should be when you save on your desktop, so it goes save as, or And then uh hit that little folder up thing again.
<ME> Oh.
<PM> Uh it is in shared documents?
<UI> Where am I?
<PM> Projoct uh projector.
<UI> Project documents, yeah, it's on your desktop as well.
<ID> Again.
<ID> All the way to the top, yeah that's up to desktop.
<ID> Right and then project documents.
<ME> Okay, cool.
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> It is not giving anything.
<PM> Shared documents.
<UI> And I will tr getting strings of um information, I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular, as soon as I get them now, rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting, and then the meeting turned up, so I did.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Mm.
<ID> Did you get my email?
<ID> Okay.
<ID> Just making sure.
<ME> Okay.
<UI> So Okay.
<ME> What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material, but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material, it's a bit more bouncy, like you said they get chucked around a lot.
<ME> Um, a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> The rubber rather than Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
<ID> Yeah.
<UI> More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of.
<ID> Wow.
<PM> Um but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful.
<PM> So, whatever material we use it should be yeah.
<UI> Oh no, ethics, that's gonna cost us money.
<PM> So we have to safety point of view also, we have to take care.
<UI> Okay, safety.
<ME> Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that, so that's something good, um I dunno, I mean That's a good idea.
<UI> Yeah.
<UI> It sme smells good for children.
<ID> We could go comp yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball.
<ID> And it's got the thing on the inside.
<ID> And there's no buttons at all, it's always on, and just yell at it, and it works.
<UI> That sounds, yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball, yeah, sorry.
<ID> And then ch children will love it.
<ME> Interesting.
<ID> Oh yellow, yellow ball.
<ME> Yeah, d with the colour, um does it have to be all yellow, do you know?
<ID> Right.
<UI> Please God no.
<UI> Um.
<ME> No.
<UI> Well, I wouldn't th I mean, my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror, so I think just having it surrounding the logo.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it.
<ME> Having a little bit.
<ME> Okay cool.
<ME> Mm mm.
<UI> Yeah.
<ME> Mm-hmm, okay.
<ME> Cool.
<UI> And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it?
<UI> We put we put fashion into Whoops, it's not working.
<UI> Can't believe I've forgotten it.
<UI> We put the fashion in electronics.
<ME> Oh yeah, that's a good one that.
<UI> I bet that'll catch on well.
<ME> Yeah so.
<UI> Okay, any last worries, queries?
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Twelve thirty.
<UI> Okay.
<UI> S s I know what you're thinking.
<PM> Hmm.
<UI> Okay then, lunchtime, yay.
<PM> That's good.
<UI> Okay, that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one.
<UI> This is quite fun actually.
<ME> Wow.
<ID> Mm.
<ME> Has anybo oh.
<UI> I really don't Yeah, yeah.
<ME> Has anybody pressed okay, it vibrates.
<ME> It's pretty cool.
<ID> Yep.
<PM> Check here.
<UI> Wow you've your first page.
<UI> I was just writing really big.
<ME> Yeah, got small writing.
<ID> Yeah I've been using up the pages.
<ME> I don't wanna waste it.
<UI> I've finished the meeting now.
<UI> Oh, everybody needs k questionnaire.
<ID> Another questionnaire.
