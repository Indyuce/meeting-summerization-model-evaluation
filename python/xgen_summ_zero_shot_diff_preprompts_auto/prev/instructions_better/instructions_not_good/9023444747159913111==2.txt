### Assistant: The speaker is asking Christiane if she will be going to visit her sister in Istres soon. Christiane responds that she and her family are preparing for Myriam and Emmanuel's upcoming wedding. She goes on to say that the little Arlesienne, Myriam's maid of honor, is "mignonne comme tout" (sweet as can be), but not quite as adorable as Myriam and Emmanuel. The speaker then asks if the maid of honor will wear a local dress called a 'robes d'Arles' or a traditional wedding dress. Christiane responds that she thinks she will wear a traditional wedding dress.
