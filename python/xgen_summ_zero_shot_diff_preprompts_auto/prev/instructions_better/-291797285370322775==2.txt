A chat between a curious human and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the human's questions.

### Human: Summarize the following text and include an introduction that contextualizes it, as well as a list of keypoints.

E2: Dis voir Christiane, tu vas descendre bientôt chez ta soeur à Istres?
C: (bruit de papier) Ah ben euh, on descend pour le mariage de Myriam et, et Emmanuel.
C: Oui, (XX) sont en plein préparatifs, bien entendu.
C: La petite Arlésienne, elle est mignonne comme tout, enfin bon.
E2: Et alors elle aura la robe de l'Arlésienne non?
C: Oh non, je pense pas qu'elle ait un costume régional, je pense.
C: Je pense qu'elle aura une tenue euh <E2: De mariage traditionnel.> classique de mariée. Je pense.

### Assistant: The conversation between E2 and C seems to revolve around a wedding in Marseille, specifically the upcoming wedding of Myriam and Emmanuel. The two characters discuss the name and appearance of the bride-to-be, who is thought to be from the Aude region. C does not believe that she will wear a traditional wedding dress from the area, instead suggesting that she will wear a "traditionelle" (E2's word) marriage dress. The conversation ends with E2 inquiring about the color of the bride's dress to which C replies "Je ne sais pas" (E2's word).
