E2: Dis voir Christiane, tu vas descendre bientôt chez ta soeur à Istres?
C: (bruit de papier) Ah ben euh, on descend pour le mariage de Myriam et, et Emmanuel.
C: Oui, (XX) sont en plein préparatifs, bien entendu.
C: La petite Arlésienne, elle est mignonne comme tout, enfin bon.
E2: Et alors elle aura la robe de l'Arlésienne non?
C: Oh non, je pense pas qu'elle ait un costume régional, je pense.
C: Je pense qu'elle aura une tenue euh <E2: De mariage traditionnel.> classique de mariée. Je pense.

### Assistant: The following is a summary of the conversation:

Christiane was asked by E2 if she was going to visit her sister in Istres soon.
Christiane replied that yes, she was going to visit her sister for Myriam and Emmanuel's wedding.
Christiane stated that they were in the middle of wedding preparations, of course.
Myriam is very cute, but unfortunately, she is not regional clothing.
Instead, Christiane thinks that she will wear a traditional wedding dress.

The discussion at the beginning of the conversation shows no tension or argument: the two people appear to be pleasant and light-hearted. It also does not show how the subject is resolved because there is no resolution given in this text. The lack of conclusion and the abruptness of the discussion make it difficult to understand the purpose or outcome of this conversation fragment, so it is unclear how this conversation piece reflects the debate on regional styles and how it is structured.
