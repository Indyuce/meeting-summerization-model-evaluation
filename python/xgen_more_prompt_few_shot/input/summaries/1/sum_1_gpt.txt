This meeting aims at planning a jazz and soul music festival. The organisers decided to invite the jazz pianist Marcus Williams and the vocalist Sarah Collins. It will take place on SÃ¨te hilltop, with a panoramic view of the sea. This location will make a perfect backdrop for the music. A vintage-inspired stage with modern lighting effects has been selected, as well as giant saxophones and venyl records for the decoration. They want to set up food trucks from local vendors offering everything from seafood delicacies to soul food. A professional security team will be enrolled to keep the entrances and patrol the festival grounds. A medical tent will be deployed, with a team of paramedics on standby. Sound engineers, equipped with top notch sound equipment will ensure the quality of the representations.
