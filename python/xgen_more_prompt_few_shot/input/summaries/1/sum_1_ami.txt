This meeting involved employees from Real Reaction electronics company, gathered for the first time around the project of designing an original, trendy, user-friendly remote control. They introduced themselves, the project and started to train with the drawing tools to share images. They were asked to draw an animal to get familiar with the functionalities. Then, the financial goal was announced, a 50 million euros profit for a 25 euros price. To reach this goal, they want to target multiple cultures and trends on the international market. The selling price limits the functionalities, like having a screen built-in the remote control. They want the remote to be universal, shock proof and water proof, and they will assess the production cost of infrared technology that allows operating from another room.
