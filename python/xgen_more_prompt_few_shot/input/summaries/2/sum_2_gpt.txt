In this meeting, the 4 organisers are planning the jazz and soul music festival in Sète Village.

They have chosen Sète hilltop to put the stage. The atmosphere will benefit from the unique panoramic view on the sea and this location will make a perfect backdrop for the music. On stage, there will be giant saxophones and venyl records, in a vintage-inspired way with modern lighting effects. Sound engineers, equipped with top notch sound equipment will ensure the quality of the representations.

To perform on stage, the organisers decided to invite the jazz pianist Marcus Williams and the vocalist Sarah Collins. 

To keep the entrances, a professional security team will be enrolled. They will also patrol the festival grounds. A medical tent, with paramedics on stand by will be deployed. These measures ensure the safety of the event. Food-trucks with local vendors will offer everything, from seafood delicacies to soul food.

Overall, this meeting permitted to choose the guests, the location, the food and the design of the event. They also mentioned the requirements in terms of human resources. The organisers were all really excited and motivated to bring this event to life.
