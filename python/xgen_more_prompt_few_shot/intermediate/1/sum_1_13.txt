PB: Um, good morning, everyone! So, as you all know, we're here to discuss the organization of the Jazz and Soul Music Festival in Sète Village. Uh, we want this festival to be something really special, you know? Original, unique, and a real treat for all the music lovers out there.

PB: First things first, let's talk about the invited artists. We're thinking of having some renowned jazz and soul musicians, but also a few surprises to keep things exciting. How about we invite the legendary jazz pianist, Marcus Williams? And for soul music, what do you all think of getting the incredible vocalist, Sarah Collins, on board?

PA: Um, yeah, I love the idea of having Marcus Williams and Sarah Collins. They're both amazing artists, and I think they'll bring a lot of energy to the festival.

PD: Mm-hmm, totally agree with that. Marcus and Sarah will definitely set the stage on fire!

PB: Great, glad we're on the same page. Now, let's talk about the location. We've scouted some places, and we found this beautiful hilltop location in Sète Village with a panoramic view of the sea. It's going to be a breathtaking setting for the festival.

PC: Um, that sounds fantastic! Having the festival on a hilltop will give it a unique atmosphere and a perfect backdrop for the music.

PB: Exactly! And, keeping in mind the festival's theme, we can have some amazing decorations, like giant saxophones and vinyl records as part of the stage design.

PA: Oh, I love that idea! It'll really enhance the overall ambiance of the event.

PB: Moving on, let's discuss the food arrangements. We want to offer a diverse range of cuisines, so people can enjoy their favorite dishes while grooving to the music. How about setting up food trucks from local vendors offering everything from seafood delicacies to soul food?

PD: Mm-hmm, that's a great idea! I can already imagine the aroma of delicious food filling the air during the festival.

PB: Alright, now let's talk about security. We need to ensure everyone's safety throughout the festival. We'll have professional security personnel stationed at the entrances and also patrolling the festival grounds. Plus, we can set up a medical tent with a team of paramedics on standby.

PC: That's a crucial aspect, and it's good to know we're taking security seriously. We want everyone to have a great time without any worries.

PB: Absolutely. Lastly, let's discuss the technical aspects, like sound and stage setup. We'll need to bring in top-notch sound equipment to ensure the artists' performances are exceptional. Also, we'll have a team of experienced sound engineers to handle the audio.

PA: And what about the stage design? Are we going for a classic look or something more contemporary?

PB: Um, we can do a combination of both. How about having a vintage-inspired stage with modern lighting effects? It'll be a visual delight for the audience.

PD: Sounds good to me. I think that mix will complement the music styles we're focusing on.

PC: I'm really excited about this festival. It's going to be a memorable experience for everyone attending.

PB: Um, yes, absolutely! I think we're on the right track to make this festival a huge success. Let's all put in our best efforts, and I'm sure it'll be a hit!

P1: Valérie Pécresse, Éric Zemmour, whether you're assertive, towards each other, that's fine. Be respectful, and let's ensure this debate is heard, it's the least we can do. Today, an important current event has occurred: one of the twelve qualified candidates, Emmanuel Macron, who is currently leading according to polls, has made a proposal. It's related to the economy. He wants to raise the legal retirement age to sixty-five, which is not the case today. You know this. Valérie Pécresse, you have repeatedly accused President Emmanuel Macron of emptying the treasury. Now, he's filling it up again. If he does that, he'll also replenish the pension funds. So, he's repenting. Do you appreciate this measure as it deserves?

Valérie Pécresse (VP): What we see is that what Emmanuel Macron the candidate promises is everything Emmanuel Macron the President has not done. But, on economic issues, it's still very important. Uh, because I know for Éric Zemmour, it's totally secondary, as in his program, he has 150 billion in unfunded expenses.

Éric Zemmour (EZ): Why not a thousand billion while we're at it!

VP: One hundred fifty billion, that's the estimate, right?

Host: He also raises the retirement age to sixty-four.

VP: To sixty-four years, but that's the only reform he's doing. No reduction in civil service jobs, no reform of unemployment insurance. No courageous reforms, no reform of the RSA (social welfare program). Our country needs reforms.

EZ: I remove the RSA for foreigners, isn't that courageous?

VP: There are only five million foreigners in France. It represents only ten percent of the benefits, which is four billion. So, nothing is funded in Mr. Zemmour's program, which promises extravagant expenses.

P1: Let's get back on track, retirement at sixty-five. Valérie Pécresse, the president you may become, will you apply a reform that will more or less approach this? Will you tell the French people, "As president, retirement will be at sixty-five"?

VP: Well, I, I've already said, I will do this reform, up to sixty-five, except for French citizens who are worn out by their work, with a long and arduous career. I said I would do this reform. I said I would reform unemployment insurance, I said I would reform the state. I said I would cut two hundred thousand civil service jobs.

Host: One thousand one hundred euros minimum pension, says, uh, candidate Emmanuel Macron. You say one thousand euros.

VP: No, I say the net minimum wage, because with this reform, I can allocate resources up to the net minimum wage so that no retiree will retire without it. And I propose to increase widow's pension from fifty-four percent to seventy-five percent for widows with incomplete careers.

EZ: It's just copy-pasting, madame.

P2: We're not in a playground. We're not in a playground, so, uh, Eric Zemmour, respond, uh, respond. Valerie Pecresse said that you're not making any substantial reforms, and that your solutions, that is, essentially cutting some expenses related to immigration, wouldn't be enough to, uh, cover the deficits and implement fundamental reforms.

EZ: I never said that. I have been saying, uh, for months, about raising the retirement age to sixty-four. So, it's in the same vein. Uh, it will save us, approximately, according to calculations, twenty billion euros. I do not propose, indeed, you're right, I don't triumphantly announce reductions in the public workforce because, uh, I understood, during the 2017 campaign, that it was all just empty words. Uh, you know, no one fulfills them, ever. They promise a hundred and fifty thousand, two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, four hundred thousand, and then, they don't do it. You won't do it.

P1: It can be done, Mr. Zemmour.

EZ: That's what I was going to say. I say, we shouldn't promise, we should, when in power, make a strict assessment of the needs. There are sectors, even Mrs. Pecresse acknowledges it, where we'll need to hire, like the justice system, for example, and healthcare, you agree on that, at least, right? So, there will be sectors where we need to look at excess staff and see where we can cut jobs, etc. But we can't do it just like that, on a whim, saying a hundred and fifty thousand, two hundred thousand, it's all just talk.

P2: But will you do it?

EZ: Yes, but we will have a systematic method, and we'll see. The same goes for decentralization; I propose taking up Mr. Sarkozy's reform, which was to merge, you remember, uh, the territorial council, which was the departmental council, and the regional council, uh, which allows for savings. So, there will be savings. So, I repeat, cutting social benefits for non-European non-contributors is twenty billion, not four billion, Mrs. Pecresse.

VP: There's forty billion, ten percent of forty billion is four.

EZ: You're including the RSA.

VP: The RSA is already like that.

EZ: No, foreigners get the RSA after five years of residence. I'm sorry, after five years of presence, foreigners can get it, so, please, don't act smart. Secondly, there is, there is, there is, the fight against social fraud, which can be estimated at fifteen billion. That's a low figure, as it's estimated between fifteen and forty-five billion, even by the Court of Auditors. So, you see. Moreover, uh, there are budgetary savings to be made, I repeat, so it's fully funded. Furthermore, we have a program to ease economic burdens, with thirty billion in tax cuts for production, which will create wealth. We have a, uh, a reduction system for the corporate tax. Uh, as we raise the threshold, which is currently at thirty-eight thousand, up to three hundred thousand. It creates economic activity, it creates wealth.

VP: These are promises galore, and there's nothing.

EZ: Because you, you also make promises galore, you're right.

VP: In your program, the CSG [General Social Contribution] and the hospital won't be compensated. I'll tell you why; you need to announce the two hundred thousand job cuts. Because, if you don't announce it beforehand, you won't do it afterwards.

P1: Sometimes we plan ahead and still don't do it afterward.

EZ: Thank you, Mr. Bouleau.

VP: But Mr. Sarkozy, Nicolas Sarkozy, the last president who announced it, he did it.

P1: François Fillon promised three hundred and fifty thousand.

VP: He wasn't elected.

EZ: Emmanuel Macron promised a hundred and fifty thousand.

VP: I am not Emmanuel Macron.

EZ: You're the same.

VP: In my region, I promised ten percent job cuts. I did it. I saved two billion euros. Why am I talking about savings? Because you can say that the economy is secondary. But no, it's not secondary. A country's power comes from its economic strength.

P2: Nobody said it's secondary.

VP: And Eric Zemmour, with his program that's absolutely unfunded, has a program, just a program.

EZ: Just because you say anything doesn't mean you'll eventually make people believe it.

VP: François Fillon said that the state is bankrupt. It was ten years ago, and we have a thousand billion more in debt. We are at a breaking point. We need to make reforms, and Eric Zemmour said, we don't need reforms.

### Assistant: During a debate between candidates Valérie Pécresse and Éric Zemmour, they discuss Emmanuel Macron's proposal to raise the retirement age to sixty-five. Valérie Pécresse criticizes Macron's past performance and his lack of substantial reforms. She advocates for reforms in various sectors and pledges to raise the retirement age except for those with demanding careers. Éric Zemmour supports raising the retirement age to sixty-four and proposes cost-saving measures, primarily related to immigration and social fraud. He argues for a systematic approach to cutting jobs and merging certain councils for savings. Pécresse challenges the funding of Zemmour's promises and emphasizes the importance of economic strength through reforms. The debate involves a back-and-forth exchange of views on the need for reforms and responsible fiscal policies.

<ID> So uh good morning.
<PM> Morning.
<ME> Morning.
<UI> Morning.
<ID> I see you all find your places.
<ID> Is everybody sitting on the right place?
<ME> Yep.
<ID> Yeah?
<ID> I guess so.
<ID> So Let's see.
<ID> First I will introduce myself.
<ID> I don't know if uh if everybody knows me, so I'm Bart, hello.
<ME> My name's Frank.
<ID> Hello.
<PM> I'm.
<ID> Bart.
<ID> Hello.
<ID> Hello.
<ID> Bart.
<ID> Welcome.
<ME> Thank you.
<ID> Uh let's see.
<ID> Uh let's start off um with a little presentation.
<ID> Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting.
<ID> You can see there are a few cameras here.
<ID> They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice.
<ID> Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those, because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it.
<ID> So is there a project documents folder?
<ID> There are some notes in it already I see, some documents.
<ID> Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off.
<ID> Is being modified by the administrator.
<ID> Uh okay.
<ME> Hmm, that's interesting.
<ID> Let's do it read only.
<ID> Well I don't know if you've noticed, but uh we're working for Real Reaction.
<ID> Uh it's a company in uh electronics.
<ID> We put fashion in electronics, uh we make it work, uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself.
<ID> I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project.
<ID> This is our agenda.
<ID> Uh we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing.
<ID> Uh maybe I can sit down, then I can take some notes or Let's see.
<ID> Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while.
<ME> Sure.
<ID> I dunno it's not a lot of work, but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down, just write it down.
<ID> Uh as you can see uh it's the opening, aquaintance tool training.
<ID> Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit.
<ID> Um have you all seen the corporate website already?
<ME> Yep.
<PM> Yep.
<ME> Visit it.
<ID> Yeah.
<ID> Have you seen any flaws in it?
<ID> I think I found one.
<ID> No?
<PM> Hmm?
<ME> Can't say I paid much attention to it, but Oh yeah.
<ID> I can see if it works this way.
<ID> No, it doesn't work here.
<ID> Okay no problem.
<ID> But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction.
<ID> Real Remote is not really the company we're we are, but it's just a little fault.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Um okay, what are we going to do?
<ID> Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control.
<ID> It has to be original, trendy, and user friendly.
<ID> So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you.
<ID> We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original.
<ID> And we've got our User Interface Designer.
<PM> Yep.
<ID> He's also uh That's about the new remote control.
<ID> Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through.
<ID> First is functional des uh design, individual work, meetings.
<ID> After the functional design, then the conceptual design and the detailed design.
<ID> I had some role indications on here.
<ID> But I think you know it already by yourself.
<ID> The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design.
<ID> Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept and user interface design.
<ID> And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification, trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation.
<ID> So that's a bit what you're going to do.
<ID> But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings.
<ID> Then we've got our first tool training.
<ID> We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here, so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first.
<ID> As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board.
<ID> Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side.
<ID> Here are some functions.
<ID> You can save.
<ID> N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with, only undo, you can undo a little uh piece of drawing.
<ID> A blank new document for each person.
<ID> Uh select a pen, eraser.
<ID> Capture we don't have to do anything with.
<ID> Uh then we've got our pen.
<ID> This pen.
<ID> It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> You can also select the current colour and the line width.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> But then first you have to select the pen function.
<ID> But we're going to work with it in a minute.
<ID> So okay.
<ID> Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there.
<ID> Uh then a short thing about documents.
<ID> We've got our shared folder, uh project project what was it?
<ID> Project documents I think.
<ID> But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so it will be okay.
<ID> And these are available on the smart boards as well, so if you have a document you wanna show, just open it from the folder.
<PM> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Here is a simple tool bar.
<ID> It's what I just said, it's save, print, move back or forward one page.
<ID> You can switch between the different drawings.
<ID> And then we're going to try out the white board.
<ID> So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal.
<ID> Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it.
<ID> Mouse wasn't running away.
<ME> That was interesting.
<ID> Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse?
<ID> No.
<ID> Okay.
<ME> Innocent.
<ID> We're going to uh draw animal.
<ID> And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics.
<ID> Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours, and different line width.
<ID> Uh there's I can start from now.
<ID> I will.
<ID> You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child.
<ID> Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow.
<ID> 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up.
<ID> So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate.
<ID> Then the line width.
<ID> I think seven will be nice.
<ID> Now you'll see my drawing capabilities.
<ID> These are not very much, but uh Uh, see you have to do it real slow.
<ID> Oh Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin, but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close.
<PM> Sure.
<ME> I'm thinking about a swordfish.
<ID> So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Yeah, he hasn't got an eye.
<UI> Mm-hmm.
<ID> Woah.
<ID> Now we've got another function.
<ID> We've got the eraser.
<ID> And then you can undo this easily.
<ME> Meat.
<ID> Ah it's okay.
<ID> And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics.
<ID> Uh is They've got no text tool, no.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> This is typically a undo action, I think.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> Pen.
<ID> Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down.
<ID> I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe.
<ID> But I don't know, I'm just trying.
<ID> This is not my work, okay.
<ME> Hmm.
<ID> Maybe you have to use Oh.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal?
<ID> I don't know.
<ID> It lives for the fun.
<ID> So It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin.
<ID> It lives for the fun.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Go ahead.
<ME> Thank you.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> Gonna use a different line width.
<ME> And I'm gonna draw in black.
<ME> There.
<ME> 'Kay, I'm not much of an artist, but here we go.
<ID> Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width, I think.
<PM> Hmm.
<ID> Because this is going a lot better than uh I did.
<PM> A sheep.
<ME> Mm.
<ME> Okay.
<ME> This is my um Hmm.
<ME> Sheep.
<ID> It's nice.
<ME> With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts.
<ID> Uh.
<ID> It's a real dead sheep, yeah.
<ME> There.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> For recognition, yeah, I see.
<ID> Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere.
<ME> 'Kay.
<ID> On just a Yeah.
<ME> They are Come on.
<ME> You have to go really slow when you're writing.
<ME> They're brilliant animal animals.
<ME> And that's just a little me thingy.
<ME> So.
<ME> Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer.
<PM> Okay.
<ID> Nice.
<PM> Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head, but mm Let's see.
<PM> Mm.
<PM> Uh.
<PM> Okay.
<ME> Interesting.
<ID> Sweet.
<PM> Yeah.
<PM> You know what that is?
<PM> Or who?
<ME> A rabbit?
<UI> Garfield.
<PM> Ah okay, yeah.
<ME> Garfield.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Just a Mm.
<PM> Guess.
<PM> So uh Yeah.
<PM> That's enough.
<PM> Um, you say a blank, or Okay.
<ID> Yeah, just a blank sheet.
<UI> Well I was gonna draw a cat too, so.
<UI> I'll just try something else.
<ID> No.
<UI> Something different than Garfield.
<UI> Mine is a bit more skinny.
<ID> Yeah, it's pretty skinny cat.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> But uh Well, it's supposed to be a cat.
<ME> And the most interesting tail.
<ID> Is your cat, or did you find him on the street?
<UI> I like cats because uh they are uh independent.
<ID> Ah.
<UI> The pen.
<UI> So.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> That's pretty clear.
<ID> So everybody knows how to work with the white board now?
<ID> So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board, just ask and go ahead.
<ME> Yeah.
<UI> The pen.
<ID> It's pretty uh easy.
<ID> 'Kay.
<ID> S haunted white board.
<ME> We're being haunted.
<ID> So we've got the tool uh introduction.
<ID> We move along to the project finance.
<ID> Um as you can see, we um for our remote control, a selling price is uh twenty five Euros.
<ID> Our selling price.
<ID> Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros.
<ID> Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls, so we have to work together to reach our aims.
<ID> Uh we can do it international, so we have to focus on different kind of users, different kind of cultures, and different kind of trends as well.
<ID> Um but that's all in the later stadium.
<ID> Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros, so that's also a point we have to keep in mind, that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside, and stuff like that.
<ID> It won't work.
<ID> So just try to remember these points.
<ID> Selling price twenty five, profit aims fifty million um, but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on.
<ID> And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros.
<ID> So that's leads us to our little discussion.
<ID> We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion.
<ID> So I'm gonna sit down, I think.
<ID> It's easier.
<ME> Yeah, you got a message.
<ID> I've got a message.
<ID> Five minutes.
<PM> Five minutes, okay.
<ID> Okay, that's uh good timing.
<ME> So just on a side note, why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen?
<PM> Mm?
<ID> Uh maybe you have to say the magic word.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> Right.
<ID> Does it do anything?
<ME> No.
<ID> Maybe you have to just clap it down?
<ID> Mm back up again.
<ID> No slide show.
<ID> Hmm.
<ME> It's off now.
<ID> It's off.
<ID> Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah.
<ID> You'll be okay, I think.
<ME> Well, it was on, but Ah, there we are.
<ID> Well it's those laptops.
<ID> Nice.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls, and I mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones?
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Like you can use for other?
<PM> Oh really?
<ID> No?
<PM> Huh.
<ID> You?
<ME> Well, we have a kind of broad TV at home, and a DVD player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.
<UI> No, me neither.
<PM> It's a Sure.
<ID> Ah yeah.
<ME> And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all.
<ID> Yep.
<ID> Yeah I've I've got one at home.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it, and you can use it for your television, anything else.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> And it also operates on infra-red, so you have to got the little device inside your room, and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<ME> Oh really.
<ID> So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or DVD player downstairs and you've got a link to your TV on the second floor.
<PM> Hmm.
<PM> Oh.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ID> So that's a pretty handy um thing.
<ID> Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.
<ID> It's uh That's good to remember.
<ME> Yeah.
<PM> Oh.
<ME> So I think you can take minutes again.
<ID> Yeah, that's nice, I think.
<ME> Since it's your job.
<ID> So we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red.
<ME> Yeah.
<ID> But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs.
<ID> So that uh that's something we have to find out, I think.
<PM> Mm.
<ME> Yeah.
<ME> But that would be really good if we could do that.
<ID> And other functions for a remote control?
<ID> Maybe we can make it uh uh Shock proof.
<ME> Um.
<PM> Mm-hmm.
<ME> Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot.
<PM> Sure, yeah.
<PM> Waterproof, or uh Uh, you never no know uh, I w I mean uh 'Kay.
<ME> So Yeah, one other little thing.
<ID> Sure.
<ID> Waterproof.
<ID> Okay.
<ID> So these are our um a few things we can think of.
<ID> Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder.
<ME> Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.
<ME> So you can see how much is left in the battery.
<ID> That's a battery stays.
<PM> Okay, yeah.
<ME> But they'll also really drag up the production costs, so think we'll have to see about that too.
<ID> Yeah.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Uh.
<ME> But maybe just a little LED, I don't know.
<ID> That's an idea as well.
<ID> Other ideas?
<ID> Quick ideas.
<UI> Nope.
<UI> They were all mentioned, so Okay.
<PM> Mm.
<ID> Okay.
<PM> Yeah.
<ID> Any questions about this uh presentation?
<ID> Kick off presentation.
<ME> Um.
<ME> Nope, don't think so.
<ID> No?
<ID> Okay, then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder, and then we can all work.
<ID> Finish meeting now.
<ME> Okay.
<ID> Okay.
