      "<UI> Yep.\n",
      "<UI> I'll do that next time.\n",
      "<UI> Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through, and then I'll send them to you after the meeting.\n",
      "<UI> The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one.\n",
      "<UI> Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us.\n",
      "<UI> I just sent at the last minute, I'm sorry about that, but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, the last minute, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Um and then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the remote control.\n",
      "<UI> And we've got forty minutes to do that in.\n",
      "<UI> So I would say yeah?\n",
      "<ID> You said uh targ target groups, what does that mean?\n",
      "<UI> As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Um Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Uh okay, 'kay.\n",
      "<ID> So are Okay.\n",
      "<UI> So we need to yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself.\n",
      "<UI> So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you.\n",
      "<UI> Does anyone have a preference for going first?\n",
      "<ID> Alright.\n",
      "<ID> I can go first, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> You wanna go first?\n",
      "<UI> Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours.\n",
      "<ME> Hmm.\n",
      "<UI> I assume we just pull it out?\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Um so f from the Right sure.\n",
      "<UI> Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations?\n",
      "<UI> Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back, just so that I don't have to scribble everything down.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, yeah, afterwards, yeah, okay.\n",
      "<ID> Uh okay.\n",
      "<ID> So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design, functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other.\n",
      "<ID> So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role.\n",
      "<ID> Um the identification of the components, uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person.\n",
      "<UI> Hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design, so it's a cyclical process.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, so these were the basic findings from today.\n",
      "<ID> The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email.\n",
      "<ID> Uh I just quickly jotted them down.\n",
      "<ID> Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other.\n",
      "<ID> Um okay, so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated, so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control.\n",
      "<ID> Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex.\n",
      "<ID> And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television.\n",
      "<ID> How however, our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television, in order to keep things simple.\n",
      "<ID> Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control.\n",
      "<ID> Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface.\n",
      "<ID> The user interf interface communicates with the chip, so I'll basic go over to the Okay.\n",
      "<ID> So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell, uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip, which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything.\n",
      "<ID> There is a user interface here.\n",
      "<ID> So whe when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code, which is then communicated to the remote site, which h has an infrared receiver.\n",
      "<ID> Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating.\n",
      "<ID> Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger, basically.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible.\n",
      "<ID> This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time.\n",

      "<ID> And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design, so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions.\n",
      "<ID> That's about it.\n",
      "<ID> So anything that you would like to know or No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Thanks.\n",
      "<UI> Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point?\n",
      "<UI> Br Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Um yeah.\n",
      "<UI> 'Cause that's something to consider, I guess, if we're if we're using more advanced technology, it might increase the price.\n",
      "<ID> Anything else?\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Certainly, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So so tha yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints, but um unfortunately I I do not have any data, so uh I just identified the functional components for that.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> That's fine.\n",
      "<UI> Are there any more questions, or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end?\n",
      "<ME> I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, I think that will do.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, okay.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, so do you want to Yes, shall shall we pull this up?\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> I think that has to come out of there.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Mm 'kay.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Thanks.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, I thought those last minute things, they're gonna hit you the worst.\n",
      "<ME> Oh i Okay, I hope wait.\n",
      "<ME> Should it just There's just nothing.\n",
      "<ID> I it'll take some time.\n",
      "<UI> It ta takes a little Oh, and have you you need to then also press on yours, function F eight, so the blue function key at the bottom and F eight.\n",
      "<ME> Oh right, right, right, um Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Nothin okay, something is coming up.\n",
      "<ID> Oh, there it is, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Now it's coming, computer no signal.\n",
      "<ID> It'll come up, it um uh no signal.\n",
      "<ME> No signal?\n",
      "<ME> Why?\n",
      "<UI> Maybe again?\n",
      "<ID> Yeah yeah, it says something now, adjusting Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Oh.\n",
      "<ME> My my computer went blank now.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, adjusting.\n",
      "<ME> Adjusting.\n",
      "<ME> But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now.\n",
      "<UI> There we go, there we go.\n",
      "<ME> This is the problem, but Um.\n",
      "<ID> Oh, that's strange.\n",
      "<UI> Oh, if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes, one where it's only here, one where it's only there, and one where it's both.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> And one more time.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, so one more time.\n",
      "<ME> Uh now it's okay.\n",
      "<ME> No?\n",
      "<ME> No.\n",
      "<UI> Should yeah just wait for a moment, adjusting.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Oh okay.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, that's fine, that's good.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, let's start from the beginning.\n",
      "<ME> So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up.\n",
      "<ME> Um 'kay, so the method I was um adopting at this point, it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls, uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used.\n",
      "<ME> And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities.\n",
      "<ME> And yeah, and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set, so this quite straightforward.\n",
      "<ME> And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on, switching off, uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels, or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel, so we would need the numbers.\n",
      "<ME> And and also the volume is very important.\n",
      "<ME> Um um I als okay.\n",
      "<ID> Sorry, cou could you go back for a second?\n",
      "<ID> Uh switching on off channel, uh volume, okay, that's great.\n",
      "<ME> 'Kay.\n",
      "<ME> Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design, like operating a VCR, but they don't seem to be able to deal with DVD players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size.\n",
      "<ME> And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something.\n",
      "<ME> Um then yeah, the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel, and then volume has to be there.\n",
      "<ME> But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then, um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu.\n",
      "<ME> And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> So at the for the time being that's uh that's all.\n",
      "<ME> If you have questions Yeah, and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and DVD there are the mm um video CDs and whatever, so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------\n",
      "<UI> If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management, but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and DVD, I could get back to them and see.\n",
      "<UI> It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one?\n",
      "<ID> So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want.\n",
      "<ID> Um but um so so at this stage, uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that.\n",
      "<ID> But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that?\n",
      "<ME> Um well, I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use, I mean um what other options would you have?\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ME> A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly, not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, and it'll make the costs yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, but if if you have other mm proposals um.\n",
      "<ID> Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Uh i if the if the costs allow, we can have like an LCD display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> So yeah?\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Yep.\n",
      "<ID> Cool.\n",
      "<UI> Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<UI> Do you want to yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Do you wanna give me the little cable thing?\n",
      "<ME> Uh am I going in the right direction?\n",
      "<ME> No.\n",
      "<ME> Wait.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, here it comes.\n",
      "<UI> Oh, I'm getting hungry.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, here you are.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<PM> Ah, that's why it won't meet.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, cool.\n",
      "<UI> You set?\n",
      "<PM> Yep, cool.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, functional requirements.\n",
      "<UI> Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here.\n",
      "<PM> Alright, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Hello.\n",
      "<ID> try to press oh, okay, yep.\n",
      "<UI> Is it plugged in prop it's working?\n",
      "<PM> It's working.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Excellent.\n",
      "<PM> Cool, okay.\n",
      "<PM> So what I have, wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire.\n",
      "<PM> Um so it was all about, you know, how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control, you know.\n",
      "<PM> What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and LCD screens in remote control.\n",
      "<PM> Not that they actually gave me any answers on the LCD screens, so I should have taken that bit out, but anyway.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay, so.\n",
      "<PM> What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different.\n",
      "<PM> Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly.\n",
      "<PM> Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense.\n",
      "<PM> Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know, a nice looking remote control.\n",
      "<PM> Um current remote controls, they don't match the user behaviour well, as you'll see on the next slide.\n",
      "<PM> Um I dunno what zapping is, but Oh, right.\n",
      "<UI> It's um switching between channels, sort of randomly going through.\n",
      "<PM> But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay, fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons, so that's going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control, they just make it look ugly.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Okay?\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<PM> Um so this is my little graph thing.\n",
      "<UI> Ooh, that's a bit difficult to see.\n",
      "<PM> Mm k Okay, well, I can send it to all of you.\n",
      "<UI> If you explain it to us it'll be fine.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> What it is is um it's cones, 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting.\n",
      "<PM> Um but ooh where's it go?\n",
      "<UI> I liked the, I liked the litt ooh come back.\n",
      "<PM> Back.\n",
      "<PM> Oh.\n",
      "<UI> No.\n",
      "<PM> Oh yes, cool.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay, so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> What you can't see is volume selection, it's a little bit higher than all the others.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm, that's the next one along, yeah?\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, so what the graph shows is that, you know, power, channel selection and volume selection are important, and the rest of them, you know, nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance, you know, so on a scale of one to ten, how important is that and, you know, channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential, and the power, well it's not quite so essential, apparently, although I don't understand how it couldn't be, um and everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, 'cause they're just not needed, and they're not used.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, cool.\n",
      "<PM> So um okay, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls.\n",
      "<PM> Uh that they get lost, that the uh you know, they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------\n",
      "<PM> I think if you're watching enough TV to get repetitive strain injury from um you know, watching TV, then that's the least of your problems, but you know, it's up there.\n",
      "<UI> The remote control.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Um that yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, so um I mean the the RSI thing would be that, like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know, not straining your wrists watching TV.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Yes.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, cool.\n",
      "<PM> Right, um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table, and I didn't have time to white it out again.\n",
      "<UI> That's alright.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay, but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software.\n",
      "<PM> So you can see from that that, you know, younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it.\n",
      "<PM> Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about, but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV, you know, tends to be people talking and um, you know, how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching TV.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay?\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay, so these are my personal preferences.\n",
      "<PM> So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool.\n",
      "<PM> Um you know, functional, so it's useful, but minimalist.\n",
      "<PM> Um there's a there's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got all this stuff, and you're just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it?\n",
      "<PM> You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Um okay, then a long battery life, like you were talking about earlier and um, you know, I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there, and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit.\n",
      "<PM> Um and then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah, that's it, you know.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Some kind of a ring, some Right.\n",
      "<UI> Keys and things like that, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Whistle and it screams at you, yeah.\n",
      "<PM> I know, it's weird.\n",
      "<PM> My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything.\n",
      "<PM> So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps, something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the TV, you know, 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes, 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> So okay?\n",
      "<ID> Hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<PM> That's me.\n",
      "<UI> That's you, excellent.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, that's great, thanks.\n",
      "<ME> Um that's very good, very interesting.\n",
      "<UI> Um.\n",
      "<UI> I'm just gonna tick yes.\n",
      "<UI> So, we've got about ten, fifteen minutes to discuss Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people.\n",
      "<PM> Cat's.\n",
      "<PM> Ca.\n",
      "<ID> So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned, if we want to have something sleek and uh you know, good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know, people who are comparatively elderly.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control, but I'm assuming, you know, yes.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them, so if you want to put in something stylish, then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions.\n",
      "<ID> Right, and Right.\n",
      "<PM> Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it?\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> So, you know Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, but you don't have much money, generally.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, you share a television or something that yeah.\n",
      "<UI> I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five, when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh it's on sorry, we unplugged it.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> But uh still, if if you can go back to that slide and uh, how popular was it?\n",
      "<PM> Oh, I've unplugged it.\n",
      "<PM> Do you want me to Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Oh, oh, okay.\n",
      "<UI> Here, let me Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> That's alright, if you can just look it up on your computer, wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five, uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them.\n",
      "<PM> Seventy six point three percent.\n",
      "<ME> It was seventy something, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> So even they are seventy six percent, is that high amount?\n",
      "-----------------------------------------\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds, but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean, you know, if you're at university, you're paying your rent, but you don't have a mortgage, you don't have a life insurance policy, you don't normally have a car, yeah, so.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, they've got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things.\n",
      "<ID> Alright.\n",
      "<UI> Kids.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> You're still learning to drive actually, so that just costs more than a car, but yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So you're more likely to b Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Um so I mean like it is an age group to target, really, I think.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price, that's not unaffordable, even for young people.\n",
      "<PM> No, I mean that's what, that's like fifteen Pounds?\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> You know, I think Yeah, I d I don't know many people without a TV.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah this this is not unaffordable, but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a TV to use its full Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> But do they But the TVs are often kind of someone's old TV that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote.\n",
      "<PM> We didn't have a TV last year, and everyone thought we were off our heads, you know.\n",
      "<ME> Common, the students yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> The s the stu yeah, and the remote control might not yeah, it might not even function with the old TV.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, I d well we've we've got quite a d decent TV.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular, right?\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, we're still yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So mm uh are are are Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah, but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target, because actually I mean they're all still re young people.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> You know, so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore, you know.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Is not a massive difference, you know.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five, but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition.\n",
      "<PM> No, do totally.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs?\n",
      "<ID> Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features, but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about, because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it?\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Uh and uh Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> You do have it in your mobile phone though, don't you?\n",
      "<PM> Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it, you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> I don't know.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> With um but with a TV remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five, louder, tha that should be relatively simple.\n",
      "<ME> An Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<PM> S so y you'd maybe need a code word.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> O Right.\n",
      "<PM> Do you know what I mean?\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> So like when you say change, except that's being said quite a lot on TV, so maybe like, you know, remote.\n",
      "<PM> I mean how often do people say remote on TV?\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Although I only watch Charmed, so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check.\n",
      "<UI> Um, so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money, then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah but uh um Yeah, yeah sure, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons and um, yeah it's it's kind of safer, so we we need both, so the voice recognition would be just an extra, it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, I think we need both.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> W What uh Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control.\n",
      "<ID> If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say, I want to watch uh ITV one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five.\n",
      "<UI> Uh-huh.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, that would be another way to do it.\n",
      "<UI> Uh-huh.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, so if uh if something like that can be incorporated, some kind of Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> So that if that was in the the voice recognition, that would be great.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean Sky advertise on every channel, don't they, you know, so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed, and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Watch Sky and yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, yeah, and that would be really annoying.\n",
      "<ID> Alright.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, that's Right.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "-----------------------------------------\n",
      "<UI> But that's definitely a possibility.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the TV would be already further away, so it might not pick up the other things coming from there.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though?\n",
      "<UI> So that you can yell at it, yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control.\n",
      "<PM> It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it and it'll just change it, you can look for it later, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Alright.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control, so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, yeah, I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> No, but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us, a and uh not to yell at it from the distance.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the TV, so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control, wherever it is, it'll beep, so we we can probably come to know where it is.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> That's but then if you're buying the remote separately, but y you could have something, but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the TV or something, some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack, so one part attaches to the TV.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Oh yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, yeah, mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control.\n",
      "<UI> The l Well that's right, but it solves the problem of having different noises.\n",
      "<ID> Alright, yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, definitely, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um.\n",
      "<UI> But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the buttons so it's easy to use, but only those key buttons, the major buttons and then one sort of menu one, and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um.\n",
      "<ME> The major ones, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which y you'll get immediately by email.\n",
      "<UI> Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it, so that you know.\n",
      "<ID> So where exactly is this i Ah, okay.\n",
      "<UI> It should be on your desktop, so on the yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them.\n",
      "<ME> Did you find it?\n",
      "<ME> It's just yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, yeah in that one, right yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, and email them round.\n",
      "<PM> Oh, so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there, hey?\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, that would be great.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Oh so so we'll just put them i there, we we yeah, w we won't even okay.\n",
      "<UI> Oh yeah, put them in there.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, then you don't have to email them.\n",
      "<PM> There you go.\n",
      "<PM> But is everyone's called functional requirements?\n",
      "<UI> No, they're all called something slightly different.\n",
      "<ID> No.\n",
      "<UI> Technical requirements and something something, yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, so that's good.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> That's me done.\n",
      "<UI> So, if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to.\n",
      "<PM> Okay, cool.\n",
      "<UI> Um as to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah?\n",
      "<UI> Whatever that means.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> I guess I'll find out.\n",
      "<UI> You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept, on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm?\n",
      "<ME> Uh something conceptual, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into?\n",
      "<ID> Con components, oh.\n",
      "<UI> Components, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Sorry, but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare, okay, yeah, that's good.\n",
      "<UI> No, we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare, so that's fine, w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Okay?\n",
      "<UI> Right on time.\n",
      "<ME> Cool.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec?\n",
      "<ME> Okay, see you.\n"

      "<ME> No no.\n",
      "<ME> Uh I'm done.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, jolly good.\n",
      "<ID> Alright, let's have um well, we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with.\n",
      "<ID> I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> So that's gonna be you Catherine, if we wanna hear from you first.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Um just connecting this.\n",
      "<PM> Are we getting i Really?\n",
      "<ID> You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> So I've got a very quick uh Uh.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> So the working design, I've got a very quick presentation on this, so um I've oh no, you can't see a thing.\n",
      "<PM> Oh well, I'm gonna draw it on the board then.\n",
      "<PM> It's in blue uh, and I couldn't change it.\n",
      "<UI> Oh.\n",
      "<PM> We it's fine on my screen, but never mind.\n",
      "<ID> Ah.\n",
      "<PM> So um the idea is that we've got the energy source um, which in our case will pr, oh well okay, never mind.\n",
      "<PM> So um I think maybe uh two batteries, I dunno what they're called six, or something like that.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal, which could be uh an infra-red signal, um which will be sent by an electronic chip.\n",
      "<PM> And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface.\n",
      "<PM> So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels.\n",
      "<PM> Um and that's it really for the working design.\n",
      "<ID> Great.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but Really?\n",
      "<ID> I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Um, should I erase this or Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Do you wanna just give us a moment, I just wanna copy this down.\n",
      "<ID> Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this?\n",
      "<PM> Fine.\n",
      "<PM> Or suggestions?\n",
      "<ME> Is a battery like the only way of No, no No I meant like No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying.\n",
      "<PM> Well, it's just, you don't want it plugged in really, s In indoors.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, alternate energy source, like win wind power or Bicycle power.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, you blow on it and i Yeah, it's worked for the last fifty years you know.\n",
      "<ME> The battery's down and maybe, I dunno, solar charged?\n",
      "<PM> I dunno, swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain, but Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> One question I have, and I don't know how much control we have over this is um, as far as the infra-red signal, do we have control over, you know, how far away you can be from the receiving unit, the the TV, and still have it be operational?\n",
      "<UI> I mean, maybe we want one with a strong signal stream.\n",
      "<ID> How far away is your television?\n",
      "<ID> It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be, you kno unless you've got a TV the size of a football pitch, it's not doesn't have to go that far, does it?\n",
      "<UI> Uh That's true.\n",
      "<PM> Well, the thing is uh you you don't Well, we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it.\n",
      "<ID> Doesn't have to go through a wall, because you're not gonna be looking through a wall.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down, and go into the other room.\n",
      "<PM> I didn't think about that but Why not?\n",
      "<ME> How about Bluetooth?\n",
      "<ME> Instead of using infra-red, use Bluetooth.\n",
      "<ME> Isn't that a better signal?\n",
      "<PM> I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> You know we don't need it.\n",
      "<PM> It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice, but then I don't th I dunno, either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room, you are gonna But Oh, we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage, maybe, I don't Do you need the border?\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "<ID> Basically, we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit.\n",
      "<ID> We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff.\n",
      "<ID> It's uh Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> 'S just an idea.\n",
      "<ID> Right, well done, Catherine.\n",
      "<ID> Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Sorry.\n",
      "<UI> Technical.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Adjusting.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, so, while this is warming up, there it is uh.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> So I'm doing the user interface design.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, and basically uh, as far as methods, I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there.\n",
      "<UI> Thinking of what we can retain, what we can do away with, uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um.\n",
      "<UI> we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change, I guess, I mean people want a remote that's familiar, that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics, but Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that, the basic functionality that people want.\n",
      "<ID> Mm yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control, um so up-down keys for that, uh channel keys up-down, but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want, rather than doing up-down, and uh a mute button.\n",
      "<UI> Uh one thing that I didn't include here, that I forgot that we talked about last time, was doing um some sort of lock uh function.\n",
      "<UI> Uh, I don't I dunno, uh that's one possibility.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes, ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred, which I don't know if I can access the web page from here, but I can show you uh.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> So this is a engineer centred one, so you see it's rather busy, but it also lets you play your movie, stop your movie, fast-forward, all this, um freeze frame.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Uh and this is a user centred one.\n",
      "<UI> Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do, you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Great.\n",
      "<UI> And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, uh or the direction we were going in at least.\n",
      "<UI> Um.\n",
      "<UI> So, the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality, but it can be a little bit overwhelming, so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use.\n",
      "<UI> Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh, Reissa, because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> So uh, yeah, that's me.\n",
      "<ID> Great.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Now that's I just have a q a q question for you.\n",
      "<ID> This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other, you know, existing units stuff.\n",
      "<ID> Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know.\n",
      "<UI> I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones.\n",
      "<UI> That was sort of the inspiration for it.\n",
      "<UI> Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> I've, haven't I've never seen a locking functionality.\n",
      "<UI> I dunno, what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary?\n",
      "<ID> Um I would say it's If it's simple to do, which I think it probably should be, even if it's a physical, you know, a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote, even something like that, um then yes, it's like, you know, like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing, something like that, but you know being physical.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> 'Kay.\n",
      "<UI> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Look into.\n",
      "<ID> Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well, something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit.\n",
      "<ID> It's gotta d look like it's in the R and R.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> You know, the the company it's it's, from what I can see from our other products, are yellow with blue writing on them.\n",
      "<UI> Right.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<UI> And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics.\n",
      "<ID> We put the fashion in electronics.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> I think I think we have to carry that mental.\n",
      "<ID> There you go.\n",
      "<ID> So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable.\n",
      "<ID> If if remote control well, if telephones can be fashionable, then maybe remote control units can be.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Well yeah these, I think, we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Because we need Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here, I mean.\n",
      "<UI> Uh, everything is going t ergonomic, you know, there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market, I guess.\n",
      "<ID> Great.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, fantastic.\n",
      "<UI> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Right, well done, Gabriel.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Um Reissa.\n",
      "<ME> Where does it go into?\n",
      "<ID> Let's plug you in, baby.\n",
      "<ME> Here?\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> The blue thing.\n",
      "<UI> Uh, yeah, this is getting all.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, then you just have to do function F eight and it should come up.\n",
      "<ME> Well, function F eight.\n",
      "<ME> No oh.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, w it it just takes a wee while.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, it just takes a second uh.\n",
      "<ME> Come on.\n",
      "<ME> Right.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Well, for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab, and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out.\n",
      "<ME> Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know, so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings.\n",
      "<ME> So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, so they don't like the look of the remote control.\n",
      "<ME> Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy.\n",
      "<ME> So I think we all agree with that.\n",
      "<ME> Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user.\n",
      "<ME> So, they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave.\n",
      "<ME> Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote, so probably if you have like one, two, three, four, five, the whole up to z ten, they probably don't use those, they only use the up and down channel.\n",
      "<ID> 'Cause we've only got five channels.\n",
      "<ME> exactly.\n",
      "<ME> That's another thing.\n",
      "<ME> Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap.\n",
      "<ME> Not quite sure what they mean, zap, goes like.\n",
      "<ID> I think that's k flicking quickly between channels.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote.\n",
      "<ME> I think especially for uh the older generation.\n",
      "<ME> I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones, takes ages to work how to use.\n",
      "<ME> Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room, so nobody can find them.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> So maybe tracking devices is a good idea.\n",
      "<ME> Um personal preferences.\n",
      "<ID> Wow.\n",
      "<ID> You are a child of technology, aren't you?\n",
      "<ME> Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people.\n",
      "<ME> Um has to look really cool, flashy groovy for people to buy it.\n",
      "<ME> And it's easy to find, so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating.\n",
      "<ME> So voice activation.\n",
      "<ME> So and this was what we came up with.\n",
      "<ME> Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age, sorry, age groups.\n",
      "<ME> So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes.\n",
      "<ID> So there you go, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one.\n",
      "<ME> And neither did the older generation, but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote.\n",
      "<ID> Uh but do the younger generation have the money?\n",
      "<UI> No I would I would say the older the older people, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> They they don't.\n",
      "<ID> It's older generation, they're the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there.\n",
      "<ME> Well the twenty five to thirty five year old, and thirty five, and the thirty five to forty five, forty five point seven per cent say no, so So they don't Well These guys are growing up.\n",
      "<ID> For people up to the age of thirty five, you're kinda saying, yeah, they want it.\n",
      "<ID> Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five, uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, that would be my guess as well.\n",
      "<ID> Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there, so yeah, it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent.\n",
      "<UI> What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost?\n",
      "<UI> I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> I mean, okay, there's Uh.\n",
      "<ME> Voice activation might not be the best.\n",
      "<ID> I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.\n",
      "<ME> Um also with um with buttons, a thing called RSI, so wrist sense Huh?\n",
      "<UI> Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, repetitive strains injury, so they don't I think people who watch TV maybe too often, keep changing channel hurts their wrist.\n",
      "<ME> I don't think so.\n",
      "<PM> Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much TV then.\n",
      "<ID> So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah maybe not so hard.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Maybe it could be, instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time, say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury.\n",
      "<ME> Maybe Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, we should probably consult with our legal department uh.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> They're having a lunch break at the moment, but yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> I think we can do some really in in that department, the the ergonomic department, we can make some some really good improvements.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much, or we just like flat buttons, something.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> So that is me.\n",
      "<ID> That's great, thank you very much for that, Reissa.\n",
      "<ID> Um okay, so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be, you know uh, we're going for a basic television remote.\n",
      "<ID> It's gotta be safe to use, it's gotta look cool.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> It's gotta be cheap.\n",
      "<ID> S um.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Now going back to the uh industrial design of it, you know, we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth.\n",
      "<ID> I think, we should just go with the simplest option on everything, uh and that would be infra-red, energy source, that would be batteries.\n",
      "<ID> Uh mean we we can look into using the s, you know, the little tiny weeny batteries, all like special long-lasting batteries.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years, because technology will have changed and, you know, we won't have televisions in ten years' time.\n",
      "<ID> So I think we're all um pretty sussed on that.\n",
      "<ID> Um anyone have any questions?\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Everybody happy in their work?\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page.\n",
      "<ID> Now this is good, we've got a good structure going on.\n",
      "<ID> We all know where we're going to.\n",
      "<ID> Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers?\n",
      "<UI> Oh it's probably just you, 'cause you're the project manager.\n",
      "<ME> Well, just questionnaires.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Sell trying to sell your things.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, stuff.\n",
      "<ID> Um okay.\n",
      "<ID> Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other?\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, you can.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Do all you all know my e-mail address?\n",
      "<UI> No I don't.\n",
      "<ME> I think he's participant one, aren't you?\n",
      "<PM> Well, in the project announcement, you've got the addresses, I think.\n",
      "<UI> I Uh Oh, it's just participant one oh okay.\n",
      "<PM> So Project Manager, it's participant one at AMI.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses?\n",
      "<UI> Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one, participant two.\n",
      "<PM> You have them i you have them, but we'll send you an e-mail.\n",
      "<ID> Send me, yeah yeah, okay.\n",
      "<PM> You want to have friends, don't you?\n",
      "<UI> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that.\n",
      "<ID> Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue?\n",
      "<ID> I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, but I might be just going a bit Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Well, it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders.\n",
      "<UI> Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves.\n",
      "<ID> Well, maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas?\n",
      "<PM> It wouldn't be Well you could It could come But it could come in different colours and have the RR colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the RR logo or colours and If.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Can't we have different colours in the remotes, so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain?\n",
      "<ID> Well, see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product.\n",
      "<ME> But if it's a RR, it would be Real Reaction, like if it had a symbol on it.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> There's loads of companies that called RR.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Whoa.\n",
      "<ID> This is slog but this is the slogan, this is the the the the type.\n",
      "<UI> And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups, so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> So we have to have it one colour.\n",
      "<ID> Well, not necessarily.\n",
      "<UI> Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable.\n",
      "<ID> But we have to incorporate it.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a, you know, a Panasonic product.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> It's got to so maybe, so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein, perhaps.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Quite poss yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Well this is all your department.\n",
      "<ID> Mm okay.\n",
      "<ID> Well, well done everybody.\n",
      "<ID> And um, I think we uh stop for lunch now.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, pretty soon I think, I guess that's now.\n",
      "<ME> Are we are we finished ahead of schedule?\n",
      "<ID> We might possibly have done.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<UI> Alright, see you all soon.\n",
      "<ID> If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish, then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch.\n",
      "<ME> 'Kay uh.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, there you go.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down, but Take your headsets off, kick back, smoke 'em if you got 'em.\n",

      "<PM> We've got a cool prototype.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, it's pretty exciting.\n",
      "<UI> So, everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber, very simple and easy to use, yeah, double curved, um but also something that was gonna jump out at people, something that would be different uh, separate it from the other remotes out on the market.\n",

      "<UI> So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah, that's good thinking, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> I have one thing about it, but it's a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one.\n",
      "<PM> Oh right, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> But, that's I don't see why that's not possible.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> They make left-handed scissors, you know.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family, what, they have two remotes?\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, I didn't I didn't think about that, but I'd yeah, .\n",
      "<ID> Yes s Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse, and everybody is using right-handed mouse.\n",
      "<ID> Sure.\n",
      "<ID> Sure.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons, you don't have to do anything, you know, extraordinary.\n",
      "<UI> Uh-huh.\n",
      "<ME> I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah, it's not Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Imagine d are you right handed?\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Imagine you're doing it with your left hand, I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Have them in stock.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Make 'em more appealing as well.\n",
      "<ID> But um other than that, I mean uh and that's um, you know, that's just something, I think I think it's great, yeah, great idea.\n",
      "<UI> Do you think it says RR?\n",
      "<PM> I think it does.\n",
      "<ID> I think it's, well, if the RR motto is, we bring fashion to to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable.\n",
      "<UI> Fashion to electronics.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue.\n",
      "<UI> Plus red, which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> There you go.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, very good, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> It's come up with what we've you know, the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing, hasn't it, all seems to be there.\n",
      "<ID> Well done.\n",
      "<ME> And all the playing around is uh Yeah, I'm just do you wanna plug in?\n",
      "<ID> Um before we move on I need that cable.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Thank you.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> One thing I do need to do we need to look at, is the costs.\n",
      "<UI> The costs, was that what you said?\n",
      "<PM> Play-Doh is very cheap.\n",
      "<ID> Well, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like, oops, it's gone.\n",
      "<ID> um Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> But it's edible.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Chew proof.\n",
      "<ME> Well, they'll buy more of them if you eat them, .\n",
      "<UI> That was the main criteria from the last meeting, it had to be chew proof.\n",
      "<ID> Uh right.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, now I think we'll do this I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you, so we're going for the kinetic power.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Oh ho-ho.\n",
      "<PM> Yep.\n",
      "<ID> And the electronics, we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it.\n",
      "<ID> Ooh.\n",
      "<ID> So the case, we've gone for the double curved.\n",
      "<ID> Um and it's made out of rubber.\n",
      "<ID> The interface is push-buttons.\n",
      "<ID> And button supplements well they're in diff special colours, aren't they?\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So special colours.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> It's better for And special material.\n",
      "<ID> Special form, yeah, they're a special form there in shapes and stuff.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, I mean, these these ones on the side are curved kind of, so The buttons are rubber.\n",
      "<ID> Yep.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Are they made out of any special material?\n",
      "<PM> Rubber.\n",
      "<ID> No they're not.\n",
      "<ID> They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything, they're just simple Okay.\n",
      "<ME> Well they're rubber, aren't they?\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Right.\n",
      "<ID> So let's see if that comes within budget.\n",
      "<ID> And it does.\n",
      "<ID> That is gonna cost uh Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> We're under budget.\n",
      "<ID> That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make.\n",
      "<ID> And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.\n",
      "<UI> That's cool.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So, this is all very very good.\n",
      "<UI> And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected.\n",
      "<ID> The bosses will be very pleased.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you.\n",
      "<ID> Uh.\n",
      "<ID> Save it in save it in the uh my documents.\n",
      "<ME> It's already saved, I think.\n",
      "<ID> Splendid.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> So uh, that's done with this with this um doodah, so you're.\n",
      "<ID> Gonna do what you were gonna do, your evaluation.\n",
      "<ME> Thank you.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Oh, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> This is where we all get to I get to write on the, oops, on the board.\n",
      "<ME> Right.\n",
      "<ME> Oh.\n",
      "<ME> 'S function Okay.\n",
      "<ID> F eight.\n",
      "<ID> I love the smell of that Play-Doh.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, have some have some.\n",
      "<ID> I cou.\n",
      "<ME> Okay.\n",
      "<ME> So, evaluation.\n",
      "<ME> We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria.\n",
      "<ME> I've got the criterias.\n",
      "<ME> And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria, and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria.\n",
      "<ME> And the criterias are, and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box.\n",
      "<ME> And this is false, this is just like to keep you informed.\n",
      "<ME> So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle.\n",
      "<ME> So the first criteria.\n",
      "<ME> Do you all get what we're doing?\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, cool.\n",
      "<ME> Okay, first criteria, look and feel.\n",
      "<ME> So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about?\n",
      "<ME> As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy?\n",
      "<ME> So what mark should we give for that?\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> I would give it a seven.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> As in it's not.\n",
      "<UI> Oh, sorry, one.\n",
      "<ID> Oh sorry, one, d yeah.\n",
      "<PM> A one.\n",
      "<ME> A one a one.\n",
      "<ME> So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one.\n",
      "<ME> Second criteria, new technology.\n",
      "<ME> Have we implemented new technology?\n",
      "<ME> As in the new high-tech So it's.\n",
      "<PM> Well, the kinetic thing, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new.\n",
      "<ME> So we'll give it a Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Well so the um Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> It's ergonomic, but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing, yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, but that's not a technological thing, that's another thing, i that's another marketing thing.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> True.\n",
      "<ID> So on the technical side of it it Easy to use.\n",
      "<ME> I'd say it's about a a twoish?\n",
      "<UI> It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere, maybe, yeah, I dunno.\n",
      "<PM> Two.\n",
      "<ME> Two.\n",
      "<ME> Three.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Maybe three, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> three.\n",
      "<ME> So criteria three is is it easy to use?\n",
      "<ME> I think it's a one, I think.\n",
      "<ID> I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> I would give it a I would give it a two, 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people, but Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Two, so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then?\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one, but otherwise otherwise a two.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Give it a t give it a two.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, okay.\n",
      "<ME> 'Kay, criteria four is costs.\n",
      "<ID> Cost.\n",
      "<ID> It's come in under budget.\n",
      "<ME> 's great.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So that's a definite one.\n",
      "<UI> That was great.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Amount of buttons.\n",
      "<ME> Like the amount of buttons, 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one?\n",
      "<ID> Contains only the necessary buttons.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Um criteria six.\n",
      "<ME> RSI is it good against?\n",
      "<ME> Yes.\n",
      "<PM> Yes s yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So it's anti-RSI.\n",
      "<ME> Very good.\n",
      "<ME> It's one.\n",
      "<ME> And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost?\n",
      "<ME> Is it easy to get lost?\n",
      "<PM> It's yellow.\n",
      "<ID> I don't think it's gonna get lost easily.\n",
      "<UI> It is very bright, yeah.\n",
      "<ME> No?\n",
      "<ME> But it is smallish.\n",
      "<UI> It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something, you know.\n",
      "<PM> Two.\n",
      "<UI> Maybe it will.\n",
      "<UI> Uh.\n",
      "<PM> T Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> I think i it would, could be, could get lost.\n",
      "<UI> You think it could lost Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> two.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean, it's not a one, definitely.\n",
      "<ID> I mean it No, I mean I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, anything, I mean.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<UI> It's bigger than the average mobile, I guess.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> But, yeah, it can get lost.\n",
      "<ME> The mobiles get lost all the time.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Okay, yeah, two is fine.\n",
      "<ME> But then you ring 'em and you find them.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> So Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> So, that's that.\n",
      "<ME> So that's the evaluation, so I'd say Yay.\n",
      "<ID> Alright it's all all systems go.\n",
      "<ME> It's like like a number one.\n",
      "<PM> We've, we've done well.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Um.\n",
      "<ME> Number one product.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> All done, thanks.\n",
      "<ID> We can't fail.\n",
      "<ME> We fitted all the criterias.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah, so So that's that one.\n",
      "<ID> Well done, Reissa.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know, little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it, you know, both individually and as a team.\n",
      "<ID> You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments, um and then come together and worked in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, psp, you know, especially you two.\n",
      "<ID> That's all, you know, gone very very well and and and be you know, has been good communication going on.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah, during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion, but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team.\n",
      "<ID> Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about?\n",
      "<PM> Well.\n",
      "<PM> You know It is.\n",
      "<ID> Fantastic.\n",
      "<UI> Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other RR teams, .\n",
      "<ME> been cool.\n",
      "<ID> I think So I I, you know, and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before, we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design.\n",
      "<ME> In four diff in in four meetings.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Funny, all designer meetings could be this quick.\n",
      "<ID> You know, maybe this isn't a simulation, maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just, yeah, they get Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote.\n",
      "<ME> They're using our ideas.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market.\n",
      "<ID> Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go, yeah, we designed that and no-one will believe us.\n",
      "<ID> But um No, I think when this meeting's finished like officially, there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in.\n",
      "<UI> So at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project?\n",
      "<UI> We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something?\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Y Oh really?\n",
      "<ID> Or six, uh I haven't got message.\n",
      "<ME> Just start summarising now.\n",
      "<ME> You can reply to the same message.\n",
      "<ME> See summary, there.\n",
      "<ME> If you just reply to that one.\n",
      "<UI> So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals, we had a specific number for profits that we wanted.\n",
      "<UI> It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember.\n",
      "<ME> Was it was it fifty or five?\n",
      "<UI> But there's not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we're making on profit?\n",
      "<ID> It gets handed over to another department.\n",
      "<ME> Depends how much we sell.\n",
      "<UI> Uh.\n",
      "<ID> What our what our project was was to come up with the product, basically.\n",
      "<UI> Hmm.\n",
      "<ID> the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget.\n",
      "<ID> When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and, you know, the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah, the all the guys in the profit sharing, yeah.\n",
      "<UI> But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, that's it.\n",
      "<ID> You know, we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product, we've ma we've got the prototype, it's within budget, it's does everything that we wanted it to do.\n",
      "<ME> We finished an hour earlier.\n",
      "<ID> It's new, it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already.\n",
      "<UI> I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh, you know, after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote, you know.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> We're not we're not you know, tying tying our cart to that one horse.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Well, this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that, it's that it's um, hang on, I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off.\n",
      "<ME> Definitely.\n",
      "<ID> Um that, you know, it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury, our one does the complete opposite, you know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> It make watching TV healthy.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the TV, you can f throw it about, you know.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> It's fine, it's kid proof.\n",
      "<ME> Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them.\n",
      "<UI> Uh.\n",
      "<ID> Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that.\n",
      "<ME> No.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> So all in all, I think we've done very well.\n",
      "<PM> Mm yep.\n",
      "<ID> Well done everybody.\n",
      "<ME> Yay.\n",
      "<UI> Right, you too.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Drinks are on the company.\n",
      "<PM> Cool.\n",
      "<ID> In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to.\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Glad to hear that.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> That's it.\n",
      "<UI> That's it.\n",
      "<ID> Well, as far as I t as far as I know.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ME> Yep.\n",
      "<ME> We haven't got the five minute left thing yet.\n",
      "<ID> No.\n",
      "<ID> Anyone wanna play I spy?\n",
      "<ME> Mm mm.\n",
      "<UI> I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence.\n",
      "<UI> Should we call the day then?\n",
      "<ID> Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "<ID> I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire.\n",
      "<UI> Uh, right.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before.\n",
      "<UI> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> In project.\n",
      "<ID> But I'm not the authority to say that it is.\n",
      "<ID> Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this?\n",
      "<ID> The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that?\n",
      "<ME> I love it.\n",
      "<ME> I love it.\n",
      "<ME> I think it's cool.\n",
      "<ME> Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool.\n",
      "<ME> Being watched.\n",
      "<ME> Um Wow.\n",
      "<UI> Your moment to shine.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> I thi you know, I'd I'd n yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before.\n",
      "<ID> something that t the whiteboard thingy, that's great.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",

      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",

      "<ID> Um I'm glad you could all come.\n",
      "<ID> I'm really excited to start this team.\n",
      "<ID> Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us, for our kick-off meeting.\n",
      "<ID> My name is Rose Lindgren.\n",
      "<ID> I I'll be the Project Manager.\n",
      "<ID> Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project, then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise.\n",
      "<ID> And then we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion and close, since we only have twenty five minutes.\n",
      "<ID> First of all our project aim.\n",
      "<ID> Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about, it needs to be original, trendy and user-friendly.\n",
      "<ID> I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those.\n",
      "<ID> Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts.\n",
      "<ID> First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptional design, individual work and a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work and a meeting.\n",
      "<ID> So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, we're gonna get to know each other a little bit.\n",
      "<ID> So um, what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina.\n",
      "<ID> Um Alima, sorry, Alima.\n",
      "<PM> Alima.\n",
      "<ID> Um we're gonna do a little tool training, so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you.\n",
      "<ID> Um introduce yourself, um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it.\n",
      "<PM> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me.\n",
      "<ID> Probably both.\n",
      "<PM> Right, so, I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal.\n",
      "<PM> I have no drawing skills whatsoever.\n",
      "<PM> But uh let's see, introduce myself.\n",
      "<PM> My name is Alima Bucciantini.\n",
      "<PM> Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US.\n",
      "<PM> I'm doing nationalism studies, blah, blah, blah, and I have no artistic talents.\n",
      "<ID> How do you spell your name?\n",
      "<PM> A L I M A.\n",
      "<ID> Thanks.\n",
      "<PM> Oh, and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project.\n",
      "<PM> So let's see if I can get um here.\n",
      "<PM> I will draw a little turtle for you all.\n",
      "<PM> Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal, but just that I think they're drawable.\n",
      "<PM> And you have the pretty little shell going on.\n",
      "<PM> Some little eyes.\n",
      "<PM> Happy.\n",
      "<PM> There you go.\n",
      "<PM> That's a turtle.\n",
      "<ME> Yes.\n",
      "<ID> So what are your favourite characteristics?\n",
      "<PM> Um.\n",
      "<PM> I I like the whole having a shell thing.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> It's quite cool carry your home around where you go, um quite decorative little animals, they can swim, they can, they're very adaptable, they carry everything they need with them, um and they're easy to draw.\n",
      "<ID> Excellent.\n",
      "<ID> Shall we just go around the table?\n",
      "<UI> Uh Okay.\n",
      "<UI> Well, my name is Iain uh and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Um.\n",
      "<UI> And I'll try and draw my favourite animal.\n",
      "<UI> I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off.\n",
      "<PM> No, you can erase the turtle, it's alright.\n",
      "<ID> Might be nice to have them all up there at same time.\n",
      "<UI> Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um.\n",
      "<UI> Is that at least identifiable?\n",
      "<PM> Snake.\n",
      "<ME> Well.\n",
      "<UI> It's a whale, yes.\n",
      "<ID> Em Mm 'kay.\n",
      "<PM> Well, snake?\n",
      "<PM> It's w Oh, a cat.\n",
      "<UI> Thanks.\n",
      "<ME> Oh my god, it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do.\n",
      "<UI> Um and, yeah, the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well, first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious, like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work, how they form groups.\n",
      "<UI> And I just find them interesting animals.\n",
      "<ME> Take my contraptions with me.\n",
      "<ME> Alright, I'm Jessy.\n",
      "<ME> I'm from around DC ish sort of in the US.\n",
      "<ME> And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on, animal.\n",
      "<ME> Don't really know how to draw this.\n",
      "<ME> Just where can I Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Maybe if I do the water, but how?\n",
      "<ME> Sort of give an idea.\n",
      "<ME> I have no idea how one would explain this.\n",
      "<ME> Mm maybe with some whiskers.\n",
      "<ME> Briefly, it's supposed to be a seal.\n",
      "<ME> You can imagine it in the water.\n",
      "<ME> I like them, because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time.\n",
      "<ME> Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that.\n",
      "<ID> Mm 'kay?\n",
      "<ID> I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager, from California.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Hmm.\n",
      "<ID> S Um it's actually a coyote.\n",
      "<ME> It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Let's see.\n",
      "<PM> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Let's see, let's give it a little bit of a snout, I don't know, some teeth.\n",
      "<ME> That's impressive.\n",
      "<PM> That's That's pretty impressive.\n",
      "<ID> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Cool.\n",
      "<ID> Oh dear.\n",
      "<ID> Yes.\n",
      "<ID> I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California.\n",
      "<ID> We have coyotes howl all the time.\n",
      "<ID> So I really enjoy their their singing, you they're really beautiful animals.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> Okay um, moving on to slightly more serious stuff.\n",
      "<ID> We're gonna talk about project finances.\n",
      "<ID> Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet, like it's an international market range, we don't have to worry about specifics.\n",
      "<ID> Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro.\n",
      "<ID> So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for.\n",
      "<ID> Okay um, just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um, I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls, um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control, what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like, etcetera, so Hmm.\n",
      "<ME> Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV like you have to do one for the power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going, I don't know.\n",
      "<ME> Now they keep combining all different remotes together, and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload.\n",
      "<ME> I just wanna watch the TV um.\n",
      "<ME> Always gets lost.\n",
      "<ME> Some sort of like device to help you find it.\n",
      "<UI> I've used, I've used remote controls, for things like TV and the CD player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh.\n",
      "<UI> You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice.\n",
      "<UI> Um.\n",
      "<UI> I find them they can be a bit annoying, especially, like you know if I'm watching TV I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me, you know, one for the TV, one for the digital box, one for m the video recorder as well.\n",
      "<UI> Um.\n",
      "<UI> And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing, they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off, change the channel, change the volume.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah um.\n",
      "<PM> I agree with having too many remotes around.\n",
      "<PM> My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things, and I don't know how to work half of them um.\n",
      "<PM> What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons, they are not too small, you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing.\n",
      "<PM> And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Um, I think there is a way around that, but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on, so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the TV itself, and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<PM> So I know.\n",
      "<ME> What about like batteries and things like that, like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries?\n",
      "<ID> Um I would imagine all of them, but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double As.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, something that doesn't Mm.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um MP three players now and that kind of thing.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes.\n",
      "<ID> So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote, and yet you don't wanna have five remotes.\n",
      "<ID> So how do we work with that?\n",
      "<UI> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Could we get something that just has No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about, but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off, channel changing.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ME> And maybe that spatially divides it, so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the TV on that's, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it, but if it's like all the TV stuff was here, then all the VCR stuff was here, all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together, 'cause then you like, I don't even know what I'm turning on.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> N that way Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah, and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Okay, so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, and another rote remote with all the special things.\n",
      "<PM> Um.\n",
      "<ID> Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> So like you have to have them somewhere, 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> Right.\n",
      "<ID> Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote.\n",
      "<UI> Can I ask, are we designing a remote control for a television only um, and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it?\n",
      "<ID> Good question.\n",
      "<ID> I don't know that yet.\n",
      "<UI> Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it?\n",
      "<PM> Mm.\n",
      "<ID> It's a good question.\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm hmm.\n",
      "<ID> I'll look into that.\n",
      "<ID> If I can.\n",
      "<ME> I think it's just TV, I mean, if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say.\n",
      "<PM> Mm yeah.\n",
      "<ME> You know, things might be more advanced than that.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control.\n",
      "<UI> Well, I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not.\n",
      "<PM> Yes.\n",
      "<PM> I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for.\n",
      "<PM> If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler, 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ME> It's an idea with the buttons being really.\n",
      "<PM> Large.\n",
      "<ME> Yeah.\n",
      "<PM> If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye, it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it.\n",
      "<ID> Mm.\n",
      "<UI> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas.\n",
      "<ID> Mind if we move on?\n",
      "<ID> Ps mm okay.\n",
      "<UI> 'Kay.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes.\n",
      "<ID> I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty, so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um, but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually.\n",
      "<PM> Hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Um the industrial design, Alima will be doing um the working design.\n",
      "<PM> Yeah.\n",
      "<ID> Um the User Interface Designer, that's for.\n",
      "<ID> Technical functions, I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing, the size of the buttons.\n",
      "<ID> Um user requirements um, so you'll be hearing about different trends, uh about different things that people need, um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having, we'll get from the actual consum s consumers.\n",
      "<ME> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<ID> Mm 'kay um.\n",
      "<ID> And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach.\n",
      "<ID> I realised in this past one we we didn't have much, we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done.\n",
      "<ID> Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um.\n",
      "<ID> Any questions?\n",
      "<UI> What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting?\n",
      "<UI> Do we know that?\n",
      "<ID> I haven't gotten an agenda yet, um I'll put that together.\n",
      "<ID> I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together.\n",
      "<UI> Right.\n",
      "<UI> Yep.\n",
      "<ID> So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you.\n",
      "<PM> 'Kay.\n",
      "<UI> Yep.\n",
      "<PM> I'm sure we'll be busy.\n",
      "<UI> Okay.\n",
      "<ID> Um just including all the things that we talked about.\n",
      "<UI> Can you e-mail your slides as well?\n",
      "<ID> Um.\n",
      "<UI> Is that possible?\n",
      "<ID> Yes, I yes, I think I can.\n",
      "<ID> Mm-hmm.\n",
      "<UI> Cool.\n",
      "<ID> I'll just attach it to an email.\n",
      "<ID> And you're you're number two, three, four?\n",
      "<PM> I'm two.\n",
      "<ME> I'm four.\n",
      "<ID> Is that correct?\n",
      "<ID> Okay.\n",
      "<PM> Alright.\n",
      "<ID> Excellent.\n",
      "<ID> It was lovely meeting you all.\n",
      "<ID> Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails.\n",
      "<PM> 'Kay.\n",
      "<ID> Let me see if I can do that right now.\n",
