Today's meeting focused on the design of the remote control for the product being developed. The agenda included discussing the target group and functions of the remote control, as well as the design of the remote control itself. The group identified the need for a unique design that incorporates color and the slogan of the company. They also discussed the possibility of incorporating additional features, such as a color screen, into the design. The group also identified the need for a clear and simple design that is easy to use. The next step will be to finalize the design and create a prototype.

The text is a discussion among four people (PM, ID, UI, and ME) about the preferences for a remote control for a TV. They discuss the importance of having a sleek, stylish, and minimalist design, as well as being able to use voice recognition software. They also discuss the possibility of having a beeper button on the TV so that the remote can be located if lost. They ultimately decide to target a younger audience, specifically those between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five, and to incorporate voice recognition as an option. They also discuss the possibility of having a two-part pack that attaches the remote to the TV.
