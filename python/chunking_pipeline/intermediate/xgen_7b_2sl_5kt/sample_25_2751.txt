The meeting is being led by Mandy, the Project Manager, and is focused on designing a new remote control for a TV. The group is using a whiteboard to brainstorm ideas and draw pictures of their favorite animals. They are discussing the functional design of the remote, including how it will operate TV functions, and are dividing into smaller groups to discuss and create individual designs. The group is also discussing the production cost and target market for the product.
