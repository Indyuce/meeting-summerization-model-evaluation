The meeting is about a project to create a remote control for a coffee pot. The team consists of a project manager, a user interface designer, and an industrial designer. The project is expected to make a profit of 50 million Euros, and the remote control is intended to be a universal remote control that can control NTSC, PAL, and various other formats. The team is discussing the design of the remote control and how to make it for a low price. They also mention that they will need to consider the trade-offs between different design options.

The group discusses ideas for a universal remote control. They consider different features such as touch screen design, size, and functionality. They also discuss the importance of quality and material in the design of the remote. The group notes that there may be multi-format remotes available, and they consider researching them to determine if they are worth pursuing. They also discuss the possibility of bundling the remote with a phone or other device to increase sales. The group notes that they will need to consider the target market and price when designing the remote.
