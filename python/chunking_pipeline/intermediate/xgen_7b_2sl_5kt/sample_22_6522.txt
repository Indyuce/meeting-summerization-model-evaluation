The meeting is discussing the design of a remote control for televisions. The Industrial Designer suggests that the remote control should be made of plastic, as it is the most cost-effective and aesthetically pleasing option. The user interface developer suggests that simpler functions would be better, with fewer buttons, but more functions. The voice recognition feature is also suggested, but it is not clear if it is technologically feasible or if it would be useful to the target audience. The company is considering targeting a younger demographic with the remote control. The cost of the touch screen is discussed, and it is suggested that it be included in the design. The company is also considering the possibility of including a paging function and face plates.

The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a PDA. They are considering a touch screen, battery technology, and the possibility of including different types of skins for the interface. The group also discusses the content that should be displayed on the touch screen, such as company colors and logos. They also consider the possibility of including a voice recognition option for simple functions. The group ultimately decides to go with a touch screen and focus on presentation, with a black and red interface. They also discuss the possibility of including a subliminal message that appears briefly when the device turns on.
