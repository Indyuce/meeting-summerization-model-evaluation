After discussing the evaluation criteria and the financing of their remote, the group decides to evaluate the product and its presentation. The prototype presentation is deemed to be beautiful, with the cover being removable and having a cherry fruit design. The group agrees that the product is beautiful and it is everyone's favorite. They discuss the curvature of the bottom part of the hand and whether it is a single or double curvature. They decide that it is a single curvature. The group also discusses the buttons, which are one button on each side and one button on top. They decide that the buttons will be a special color and they will be push-button interfaces. The group is under the twelve point five Euro limit and can proceed with the project.

A group of individuals discuss the marketing of a remote control for TV, with some expressing skepticism about its potential appeal and others suggesting potential marketing strategies. They mention the trendiness of iPods and Nokia phones, and discuss the role of marketing in creating demand for a product. The group also mentions the potential for a "Adam and Eve" type commercial to sell the remote control.
