The meeting is about creating a new remote control for a TV. The project aims to create a trendy and user-friendly remote control with a functional design, individual work, and a meeting to collaborate. The team will divide into three parts: industrial design, functional design, and detailed design. The project plan includes a tool training exercise, getting to know each other, and discussing project goals. The team will introduce themselves, share their favourite animals, and draw their favourite animals. The project aims to create a remote control with a maximum of 12.50 Euro per unit. The team will discuss their experiences with remote controls, what they like and don't like, and ideas for creating a new remote control.
