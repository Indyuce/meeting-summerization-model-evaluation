After a fashion design meeting, the functional design objectives are discussed. The agenda includes three presentations: one on the new project requirements, another on the remote control functions, and the third on the working design. The first presentation discusses the new project requirements and how they have been received. The second presentation focuses on the remotes of the participants and how they are used. The third presentation is on the working design and how it can be made easier to use.

The text is a summary of a meeting discussing the development of a remote control for a television. The participants identify the target group for the remote as being people aged between fifteen and thirty-five, and emphasize the importance of simplicity and fashion in the design. They also discuss the possibility of including a button to allow the remote to be found if it is lost, and consider adding extra functions that can be accessed through hidden buttons. The participants also discuss the possibility of using a rechargeable battery and the possibility of using a mobile phone charging cradle instead of a battery.
