A group of people are meeting to design a new remote control. They are using a PowerPoint presentation to discuss the project, including the functional and conceptual design of the remote, as well as the production process and target market. The group is also discussing the characteristics and preferences of different animals, as a way to brainstorm ideas for the remote control. They plan to reconvene in 30 minutes to continue their discussion.
