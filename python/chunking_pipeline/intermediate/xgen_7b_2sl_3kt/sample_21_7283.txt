They are also discussing their goals and objectives for the project and how they plan to achieve them.

The text is a conversation between two individuals discussing the possibility of building a universal remote control for sale internationally. The project is expected to make a profit of 50 million Euros, and the remote control is expected to do more than just control TVs and DVDs, but also other devices. The designers are tasked with creating a universal remote control that can control various formats such as NTSC and PAL. The goal is to make the remote control as small as possible while still being functional. The designers are encouraged to think about what the user wants and needs, and to come up with ideas for the remote control's functionality. The project manager will provide more specific instructions and assignments in the next meeting.

A group of individuals discuss ideas for a new product, a remote control with a built-in locator device.

They also mention the possibility of bundling the product with a phone and the potential for a multi-plate face plate. They discuss the importance of considering the target market and the potential for the product to be sold overseas. The group agrees to continue working on the product and to document their ideas in project documents.
