The meeting begins with the Project Manager, Rose Lindgren, introducing herself and the project, followed by a discussion about the project's goals. The team will be divided into three parts: the functional design, individual work, and then collaborating. The team will introduce themselves and draw their favorite animal. The user interface designer, Iain, will draw a whale, while the rest of the team will draw their favorite animals. The team discusses their favorite characteristics of animals and the project's theme. The project aims to create a new remote control with three goals: originality, trendiness, and user-friendliness. The team will work together to achieve all three goals.

A group of individuals are discussing a remote control for a television. They are considering whether to include video recorder functions and whether to stick to television-related buttons only. They also discuss the importance of having large, easy-to-press buttons for older people or those with less coordination. They plan to continue discussing new ideas and move on to the next meeting. They also mention that the industrial designer will be working on the working design, the user interface designer will be focusing on technical functions, and they will be discussing the next meeting's agenda.
