The text is a summary of a meeting where the participants discuss a remote control design for a television. The design must be made of television-only materials, with the company colors included and the slogan "Fashion in Electronics." The design must not include teletext or any other features. The Industrial Designer presents their findings on the limitations of using metal in the design, and suggests using solar power with an alkaline battery backup and a high-grade recycled plastic user interface. The chip should be silicon-based and infrared, with multi-channel compatibility and a range of 200 feet. The receiver can only be used with televisions. The User Interface Developer presents their findings on the requirements and functions of the remote control. The design should send messages to a television set to switch on, switch to a channel, and perform other basic functions. The design should be simple and easy to use, with a limited number of buttons. The design should not be complicated or expensive. The final decision on the design will depend on the aesthetic value of plastic materials.

The group discusses the development of a remote control for a television. They consider adding a touch screen and voice recognition features, as well as the option for a sleek, simple design. They also discuss the possibility of including a paging function and the cost of materials. The group ultimately decides to focus on the touch screen and voice recognition features, and to evaluate the market for these features before making a final decision on the design.

A group of individuals discuss the design of a remote control, including the possibility of using a touch screen instead of a button. They discuss the importance of having the logo displayed on the remote control, and the potential for a subliminal message to appear briefly when the remote turns on. They also mention the potential for the remote to go into a sleep mode and the benefits of using a touch screen instead of a button. The group agrees that they are good to proceed with their discussion.
