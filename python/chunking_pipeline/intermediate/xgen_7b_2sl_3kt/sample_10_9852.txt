The text is a conversation between two people discussing the target audience for a product. They discuss the popularity of voice recognition technology and its potential use in a remote control for a TV. They also discuss the target age group for the product, with the younger group being more likely to pay more for a voice recognition remote control. They also mention the possibility of incorporating both voice recognition and traditional buttons for the remote control.

A meeting is wrapping up, with participants discussing the requirements for a product to be used by 15-35 year olds. The product should have simple buttons for major functions, with voice recognition as an optional feature. Participants will send their presentations and questionnaire responses to the facilitator, who will compile them into a project document folder. The next meeting will focus on the user interface concept and trends in voice recognition technology. Participants will have 30 minutes to prepare before the meeting.
