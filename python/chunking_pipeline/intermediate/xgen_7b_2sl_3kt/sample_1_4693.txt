A group of individuals, including a project manager and three industrial designers, are discussing a project to design a new remote control. They are given individual work and then meet to discuss and repeat the process three times. During the meeting, they are given the opportunity to draw their favourite animal and summarize its characteristics. The project is expected to be a success, but the team is unsure about how it will be received in the market.

The meeting discusses the design of a new remote control for various devices in the home. The participants identify the need for a combined remote control that can control multiple devices, such as televisions, DVD players, and VCRs. They also discuss the possibility of adding new functionalities to the remote control, such as lighting control and note-taking capabilities. The industrial designer will be working on the functional design of the remote control, while the user interface and technical functions will be handled by the technical team. The meeting concludes with a discussion on the production cost and how much functionality can be packed into the price cap.
