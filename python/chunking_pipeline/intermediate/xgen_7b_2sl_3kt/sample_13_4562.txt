The meeting discusses the project aim of creating a new remote control. The tool training involves trying to draw the favourite animal of each participant and writing down their favourite characteristics. The project method involves individual work, a meeting to discuss details design, and a meeting to review the design. The tool training involves drawing the face of a cat, and the participants are encouraged to describe how the rest of the animal looks. The meeting also discusses the market range for the remote control and the production cost. The participants are asked to discuss their experiences with remote controls and ideas for the new remote control. The meeting is expected to continue at quarter to twelve.

The meeting discusses the design of a remote control for a TV. The team has identified technical functions they want the remote to have, such as controlling the TV and connected devices like DVD players. However, they also want to have a backup plan in case the remote control is too expensive to produce. The team suggests having a basic, ergonomic remote that only controls the TV, with a focus on making it look nice and easy to use. They also want to consider making it accessible for people with disabilities or visual impairments. The team is encouraged to come up with ideas quickly and to think outside the box, such as creating a remote with a flip-up lid to prevent accidental button presses. The meeting is scheduled to continue in 30 minutes.
