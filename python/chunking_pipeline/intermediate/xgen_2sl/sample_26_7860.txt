The second meeting was about the functional design of a remote control. The goal of the meeting was to determine the user requirements and technical functions of the remote control. The group discussed the current remote controls and their problems, such as being ugly and not being user-friendly. The group also discussed the technical functions of the remote control, such as sending messages to the TV and controlling volume, channel, and playback functions. The group also discussed the design of the remote control, including the number of buttons and their functions. The group also discussed the budget and the target audience.


The group discussed the design of a remote control. They noted that the engineering ones are more complex and not necessary for most users. They suggested that the remote should be simple and user-friendly, with a modern design. They also discussed the importance of including the most commonly used buttons, such as channel, volume, and power, and the possibility of using speech recognition technology to make it more user-friendly. They also discussed the need for a power source and a smart chip to make it multi-functional. The group also discussed the design of the remote control and its features.

The group is discussing a remote control for a TV. They are considering making it universal, trendy and user-friendly. They are considering making it have a small painting, and possibly a subcomponent that diverts power to different parts of the device. They also want to make the front of the remote flashy and have a large on-off button. The group is also considering making the buttons glow in the dark and using the chip and infra-red bulb for communication with devices. The group is also considering making the device have a key that glows in the dark and using a switch to control power. The group is also considering making the device have a large on-off button and using the chip and infra-red bulb for communication with devices.

The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They want to make it simple and easy to use for people of all ages, but not too technically literate. They also want to make sure it is easy to find and has a battery source and a charger. They are considering adding speech recognition to the remote, but are unsure about the cost and feasibility. The group will discuss further and make a decision about the specifications of the remote.


The group discussed the design of a remote control for a television. They discussed the need for only essential buttons such as on/off, volume, mute, and channel up/down. They also discussed the need for a menu button that provides access to audio and video settings such as brightness, colour, and subtitles. They also discussed the possibility of using a strip of yellow text at the bottom of the remote control to indicate the current channel. They also discussed the possibility of using a yellow light or stripes to indicate the current volume. They also discussed the possibility of having a sub-title button that pops up with a menu on the TV. The meeting was concluded and the next meeting will be held in half an hour.
