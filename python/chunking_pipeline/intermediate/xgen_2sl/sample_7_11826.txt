The meeting will have a similar format as the last one. The first two screens have been switched over. The minutes of the last meeting have been emailed to everyone. There are no questions from the last meeting that are bothering anyone. Raj will discuss trends in the market and how they affect the market potential. The most important factor is the outlook of the remote control, which should have a fancy design. The second most important factor is that the remote control should be technologically innovative, with features like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition. The third most important factor is that it should be easy to use, with no complicated buttons. The fourth most important factor is that customers should be provided with manuals in their local language. The fifth most important factor is that the remote control should be durable. The sixth most important factor is that it should be eco-friendly. The seventh most important factor is that the remote control should be easy to replace. The last most important factor is that the remote control should be aesthetically pleasing.

The group discussed the design of remote controls and found that most remote controls use a graphical interface with buttons that are pointed rather than having a stream of text or something. There is inconsistency in the layout of existing remote controls, which makes it confusing. They also found that there is a need for a consistent layout and shape. They have some pictures of new remote controls to show you and some ideas for their design. They are considering using a voice recognition system, but it may be expensive and confusing. They also found that LCD and other features may be expensive and not practical for their budget. They are considering incorporating speech recognition software into their design. They also discussed the personal preferences and the market survey they have conducted. They are looking for a new design that is both technologically advanced and has a fancy outlook.

The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They are considering different options, including using LCD technology, color screens, and different shapes and colors for the buttons. They are also considering the cost and ease of use of the remote control. They have received a list of competition and are discussing how to incorporate their own ideas into the design. They are also considering using different materials for the remote control, such as plastic, wood, or latex.


The group discussed the design of a remote control, specifically for a TV. They discussed the shape and colour of the remote and the functions it should have. The group also discussed the idea of having a banana shaped remote control, but ultimately decided that a fruit or vegetable shape would be more appealing. They also discussed the idea of having different coloured buttons and using a rubber or spongy material for the remote. The group also discussed the idea of using a microphone for speech recognition and a scroll-wheel for easy scrolling. They also discussed the idea of holding the remote in one hand and using the other hand to point it.


The group discussed the design of a remote control for a TV. They decided that the microphone should be held in a way that allows for voice recognition, and that the remote control should be easy to hold and not too heavy. They also discussed the idea of using a strip of glow-in-the-dark material around the remote control. The group also discussed the idea of using buttons instead of a fruit shape for the remote control. They decided that the remote control should be designed to fit into a mobile phone casing of different shapes, so that people can choose the casing that fits their preference. The group also discussed the idea of having a selection of casings that can be fitted onto the mobile phone, so that people can choose the casing that fits their preference. They also discussed the idea of having buttons on the upper side of the remote control, and a half-covered lower side that can be fitted with a casing in different shapes, such as banana or apple.

The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a company. They want it to be ergonomically shaped and organic, with a focus on natural and fruit-related shapes. They also want it to be durable and easy to hold. They have considered using a hand-dynamo as an energy source and have discussed using rechargeable batteries. They also want to make the main body of the remote a different colour than the logo and slogan running along one side. They have also considered using solar power, but have decided against it because the days when there is no sunlight are too frequent. They have also considered using a rechargeable battery and have decided on a pale yellow main body with the logo and slogan running along one side. They also want to make the remote shakeable and have a hand-dynamo as an energy source.

The group has also discussed the user interface and the buttons. They have discussed using a rechargeable battery and have decided on a pale yellow main body with the logo and slogan running along one side. They also want to make the remote shakeable and have a hand-dynamo as an energy source. They have also discussed the features and have decided to keep it simple and not add too many features. They also want to keep the LCD screen out. They have also discussed the cost and have decided to keep it under budget. They have also discussed the speech recognition feature and have decided to use the cheapest option of chip.
