The meeting is a detailed design meeting for a remote control for a vegetable peeler. The prototype has been presented, and Cat will present evaluation criteria to evaluate the product. The product must fit within the financial criteria and be evaluated against the criteria from Cat and the financial limits. The meeting will also evaluate the process of production and design. The meeting is scheduled for 4:15 PM and has 40 minutes. The remote control is a flip open device with a rubber body and a user interface with an LCD and a scroll. The design is based on the shape and color of a banana, and the back side is round. The user interface has basic buttons for numbers, an on/off button, and buttons for flipping channels. The volume is scrolling on the side and can be muted by holding down the middle button. The meeting will also discuss the voice recognition feature.

The text is a discussion among several individuals about a product evaluation criteria and budget for a new design. The criteria include user requirements, design features, and usability. The group is using a seven-point scale to evaluate each criteria and has set up a system to input their marks. They discuss the design's attractiveness and whether it is more suitable for right-handed or left-handed users. The group also notes that the design is not perfect but can be improved with minor adjustments.

The speaker discusses a remote control and its features, such as voice control and a sample speaker. The group gives the remote a score of six out of ten, with some members giving it a higher rating. The group also discusses the components of the remote control that have been used in other products before.

The text is a conversation between two individuals discussing a prototype presentation and evaluation criteria. They are calculating production costs and discussing the design of a device. The individual on the left mentions that they have an Excel spreadsheet to help with the calculations and that they will have to take off a sample sensor. The individual on the right mentions that they have a pushbutton and a scroll wheel as part of the design, but they are not using them. They also mention that the device will not have a locator feature and that they can afford to get rid of it. The individual on the left mentions that they will need to make a selection in the LCD, but they are unsure how to do this without a pushbutton. The individual on the right suggests that they can scroll the LCD straight down for mute.

The text describes a meeting where the participants discuss a project and its design. They discuss the features of the product, such as a scroll wheel, and whether to include additional buttons for volume control. The group also discusses the color and cost of the product, and whether to include a locator feature. The group ultimately decides to keep all of the original features and design a product that includes a beeper and a case in the same color. The meeting ends with the group discussing the budget and the process of working individually and coming back to the meeting.
