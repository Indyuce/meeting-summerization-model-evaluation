The meeting begins with the Project Manager, Rose Lindgren, introducing the team and the project's goals. The team will be divided into three parts: functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. Each team member will work independently and then come together to collaborate. The Industrial Designer, Alima Bucciantini, will draw her favorite animal, a turtle, and the User Interface Designer, Iain, will not draw his favorite animal but will try to draw a whale. The rest of the team members will draw their favorite animals and discuss their favorite characteristics. The meeting is to get to know each other, introduce themselves, and share their favorite animals. The Project Manager will then move on to discussing project finances and the profit aim of 15 million Euro.

A discussion about remote controls takes place. Participants share their experiences with different types of remote controls and express their opinions on the best and worst features. Some common complaints include too many buttons, lack of simplicity, and difficulty in use. Participants also discuss the importance of having a device to help locate the remote control, especially if the TV is located in a different room. The group agrees that the remote control should have only essential buttons for turning on and off, changing channels, and adjusting the volume. Some participants suggest having separate remotes for different functions, while others argue that it would be easier to have one remote with all the necessary buttons. The group also discusses the possibility of including video recorder functions on the remote control, but acknowledges that it may not be technologically possible.

A group of individuals discuss their roles in a project and their responsibilities in the upcoming meeting. They plan to continue brainstorming and discussing new ideas, while keeping in mind the buttons and size of the buttons on a television. They will also consider user requirements and technical functions, and will receive specific instructions from their personal coach. They plan to work individually and come together to share their individual actions. They will also attach their slides to an email and keep checking the company web site and emails.
