The first meeting of Real Reaction's television remote control development team discusses the project's goals and objectives. The team includes Andrew, Kendra (User Interface Designer), Kate (Industrial Designer), and Katie (Industrial Designer). The meeting is intended to be a think tank, with no particular order and everyone contributing to the project. The team wants to create a unique, trendy, and user-friendly remote control that makes the company money. The main design tool is the whiteboard, and everyone is encouraged to draw their favorite animal. The team is looking to sell the product for €25 and make a profit of €50 million.

The participants in the discussion are discussing the design and functionality of remote controls. They mention the importance of a remote control being easy to use, with clearly labeled buttons and the ability to switch between different functions. They also discuss the importance of a remote control being able to pick up signals from anywhere and not requiring contortions to use. The participants mention that they would like to see a remote control that is not only easy to use but also stylish and practical. They also mention the importance of a remote control being able to light up, especially for those watching television in a darkened room. The participants discuss the possibility of marketing a new remote control as both fashionable and practical, and they consider the possibility of having parallel marketing schemes to appeal to different groups of people.

The discussion revolves around the design of a remote control. The participants agree that it should be dependable, have a good range, and be easy to use. They also consider adding different color or material options for the remote control. The participants also discuss the possibility of marketing interchangeable face plates for the remote control, with Andrew suggesting that a second campaign could be used to market new face plates. The participants also consider novelty items such as remote controls with different scenes from different movies. The discussion is to be continued with a more detailed look at the design.
