The meeting is about the functional design of electronic devices. The agenda includes discussing the user requirement specification, the functions design, and the working design. The presenter will present three presentations and the group will decide on the remote control functions. The meeting will last for 40 minutes and the functional design objectives include keeping in mind the user requirement specification, the functions design, and the working design. The presenter will show the results of market research conducted by Real Reaction, which found that people want a fancier looking remote and are willing to pay more for it. They also found that people are frustrated with losing their remotes and with the difficulty of learning how to use them. The group will consider these findings when designing the remote control.

The speaker discusses the design of a remote control for a television. They explain that the remote control is a communication device that allows users to produce certain effects on the television, such as changing the channel or adjusting the volume. The speaker suggests designing a new remote control by considering what the product does, how it works, and what the end-user wants. They suggest designing several prototypes of the user interface and getting feedback on how well they work. The speaker also mentions the importance of considering technological and economic factors when designing the remote control. They provide examples of existing remote controls and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. The speaker concludes by suggesting that a remote control that is both conventional in design and stands out from the crowd could be a good selling point.

The text is about a working design presentation for a coffee grinder. The designer is trying to figure out how to make the coffee grinder function and convert the energy into grinding the beans. The designer breaks down the points at which energy is converted into practical function and works on each task separately. The user interface is critical as it controls the chip that converts the data into infra-red signals. The designer also mentions that the infra-red bulb is crucial in moving the data to the receiver. The four main components are the energy source, the chip, the user controlling the chip, and the infra-red bulb. The designer also mentions that they need a long-lasting energy source, a chip that works well with the user interface, and a reliable and clear infra-red signal.

The text describes a meeting where a company is deciding whether to develop a remote control for televisions that uses voice recognition technology. The company has identified a target group of younger people who are interested in this technology, but the cost of including voice recognition may be too high. The company also wants to keep the design simple and easy to use, and may consider offering both simple and advanced versions of the remote control. The company may also consider offering separate products with advanced features.

The text describes a project involving the design of a remote control for a television. The goal is to make the remote as simple and easy to use as possible, with a focus on fashion and simplicity. The project team is considering different target groups for the remote, such as teenagers and families, and is considering defining the target group by income rather than age. The team is also considering adding a function to the remote that allows it to be tracked if it is lost.

A group of people are discussing their roles in a project and their responsibilities. They are defining their functions and discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. They mention the need for large, accessible buttons for essential functions and the possibility of hidden extra functions. They also discuss the possibility of using a rechargeable battery and the possibility of using a mobile phone charging station instead. They conclude the meeting by discussing their individual actions and responsibilities.
