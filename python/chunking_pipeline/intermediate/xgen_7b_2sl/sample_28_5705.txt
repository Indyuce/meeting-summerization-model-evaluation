The prototype has a curvature on the bottom that can be adjusted to fit the hand. The buttons are one-button, and they are labeled with the channel and volume. The evaluation criteria include ease of use, fashion, and whether it feels good in the hand. The average score is a two out of seven.

The text describes a project where a team is developing a remote control for a TV. The team is using a chip with voice recognition capabilities, but it is not clear if this technology will be included in the final product. The team is also considering adding a feature that allows the remote to be squishy and fruity. The project is being evaluated based on several criteria, including whether it is innovative, technologically advanced, and whether it can be sold for under €12.50. The team is also considering adding a battery and a scroll wheel to the remote, and they are debating whether to use lithium or triple A batteries. The team is also considering adding a special color to the remote. The project is currently under budget and under the €12.50 price limit.
