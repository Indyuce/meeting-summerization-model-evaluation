A meeting is held to discuss the conceptual design of a remote control. The purpose of the meeting is to turn the abstract design into a more concrete idea. The meeting will focus on finalizing the prototype and making decisions on the design. The meeting will have presentations and discussions on component design, energy source, case design, and button design. The meeting will also consider the cost and number of chips needed for the touch screen. The meeting will be led by the project manager and participants will discuss and make decisions on the design.

The speaker discusses the idea of using visible light to make a remote control more interesting. They mention that the remote control could have light coming out of it and that it could be used to record the light with a video camera. The speaker also mentions that they would have to use a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye. They suggest having an option to turn the light on or off and also suggest using a solar battery to power the remote control. The speaker also mentions that they would like to produce the remote control in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes. They also suggest using marketing research to see how the remote control is received before launching it. The speaker also mentions that they found the idea of using visible light in a remote control to be fascinating and compelling.

A discussion takes place about the design of technology, including fashion, furniture, and technology. The group discusses the trend of organic and natural-colored designs, as well as the use of rubber as a casing material for remote controls. The group also discusses the use of touch screen technology and the potential use of rubber as a durable material that can withstand being dropped. The group also mentions the importance of easy-to-use technology and the need for innovative and fancy designs. The group ultimately decides to stick with what they have found to be successful in terms of easy-to-use technology and innovative designs.

A remote control manufacturer is discussing their ideas for new remote controls. They mention a spinning wheel with an LCD display like on an iPod, a scroll button with integrated push-button, and special components like blocking channels for children and dedicated buttons for commonly used channels. They also mention a larger universal remote control that is difficult to misplace or lose, and possibly adding a touch screen interface with go-to buttons for power, volume, and channel navigation. They also mention the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of features, and possibly adding in stupid little jokes with the voice recognition feature. The manufacturer is considering the costs and benefits of their ideas and discussing them with the other members of their team.

The industrial designers are discussing the cost of incorporating touch screen technology into a remote control. They are considering increasing the price to make money, but are unsure if they can justify it. They mention that the touch screen remote would be in a class of its own and could potentially be expensive, but they are considering other manufacturing options to reduce costs. The designers also consider the voice recognition feature as a selling point, but may have to drop it if the touch screen feature is too expensive.

A discussion takes place among four individuals about the choice between voice recognition and touch screen technology for a remote control. The group agrees that voice recognition is the lower risk option and is preferable for the time being. They also plan to develop a prototype and discuss the materials to be used for the case.

A discussion takes place about the feasibility of using solar power or lithium power for a voice recognition remote control. The group agrees that solar power would be sufficient but suggests installing a small backup battery to ensure continuous operation in case of power failure. The idea of a hand-held remote control is then discussed, and a suggestion is made to switch to a round remote control that could be placed on a table for basic functionality. The group also mentions Apple's approach to design and suggests following their lead by creating a sleek, rounded remote control. The group agrees that the new design should prioritize basic functionality and have a menu button and channel button for recording programs. The idea of following Apple's lead is seen as a good way to break away from traditional remote control shapes.

A discussion takes place about the design of a remote control for a new product. The group agrees that they want a simple and functional remote control with basic functions taking precedence over visually complex ones. They consider incorporating a touch screen, but ultimately decide against it due to cost concerns. They also discuss the possibility of an iPod-style screen with scrolling menu options, but are mindful of the budget. The group considers various design options for the remote control, including a slide or compartment for menu options, and a series of buttons with a menu button. They aim to keep the design as simple and cost-effective as possible.

A group of individuals discuss the design of a new product, a DVD player, and its buttons. They agree to stick with traditional button design, but make the case unique by incorporating rubber buttons. They also plan to target the youth market and consider different color options for the cases. The group will meet again in half an hour to continue discussing the design.

The speaker is requesting that Nathan work on the basic look and feel of a product, considering given parameters and constraints. Ron is asked to help with the layout of the product, including voice recognition and drop-down menus. The speaker wants the product to be simple and easy to use, and plans to send specific instructions to the team. The team is tasked with creating a prototype using prototype building materials and evaluating it with some pilots. The speaker is satisfied with the plan and thanks the team.
