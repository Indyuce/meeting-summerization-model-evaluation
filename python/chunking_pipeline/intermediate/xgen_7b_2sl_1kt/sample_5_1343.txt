A discussion takes place about the cost and features of a remote control. The group discusses the need for a unique design and color to set it apart from other remote controls. They also consider the competition in the market and the potential demand for the product. The group also discusses the size of the remote control and its price point. They plan to have another meeting to further discuss the project.

The speaker is looking for help with designing a remote control. They want to consider materials, shapes, and colors, and are open to suggestions from a personal coach. They are also interested in looking at competition and design. The speaker is unsure about the value of the project and mentions receiving emails and warnings for upcoming meetings.
