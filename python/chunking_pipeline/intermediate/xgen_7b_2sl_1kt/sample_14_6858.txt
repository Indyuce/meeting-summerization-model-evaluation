A meeting is called for three individuals to present their work on a project. The Project Manager explains that the purpose of the meeting is to review the work they have been doing in the last few weeks, and to discuss the final product. The Project Manager notes that the meeting is expected to last around thirty-five minutes, and encourages the presenters to keep their presentations brief, ideally five minutes or less. The Project Manager also notes that if the presenters have not created a PowerPoint presentation, they can use a whiteboard or speak instead. The meeting is ongoing, and the Project Manager is asking if anyone is joining in or if they are just doing Internet shopping.

A presentation on a remote control design is given, with the focus on the energy source and the electronic chip that sends an infra-red signal to switch on or switch channels. The audience asks questions and offers suggestions, such as using alternate energy sources like wind power or bicycle power, or controlling the signal strength. The presenter explains that the signal can be strong enough to go through walls if desired, and that the distance from the receiving unit (the TV) does not need to be too far for the remote control to be operational.

A group of individuals discuss the design of a television remote control unit. The user interface designer explains that they are looking at existing remote controls for inspiration and trying to retain what is already familiar while making improvements. They mention the importance of a volume control, numerical keypad, and mute button. The designer also mentions the possibility of a lock function and compares engineer-centered and user-centered remote controls. The group seems to be aiming for a design that maintains the basic functionality of existing remotes while adding new features.

A discussion takes place between individuals about a remote control unit for a product. The unit is designed to have a locking function, but the group is unsure if it is necessary. They discuss the importance of keeping the corporate image and the need for the unit to look fashionable. They also mention the need for ergonomic design and improvements to the layout of the remote control unit. The group discusses the possibility of making the remote control unit a niche in the market.

The report discusses the findings of a usability lab study on remote control users. Seventy-five percent of users found the remote control ugly, while eighty percent would spend more money if the remote control looked cool and fancy. The current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user. Eighty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, and seventy-five percent of users zap quickly between channels. The older generation takes longer to learn how to use a new remote, and remote controls often get lost in the room. The majority of users, except for the forty-five to fifty-five year olds, do not want a voice-activated remote. The younger generation, who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice-activated remote. However, the manufacturing cost of a voice-activated remote is a concern.

The meeting discusses the design of a basic television remote control. The group decides to go with a simple design that is safe, looks cool, and is cheap. They consider using infra-red or Bluetooth as energy sources, but ultimately decide to go with infra-red due to its simplicity. The group also discusses spam emails and e-mail communication within the team.

A meeting is held to discuss the design of a remote control for a product called Real Reaction. The participants are participant one, participant two, and the Project Manager. The participants discuss the color and design of the remote control, with the Project Manager suggesting that it should be a single color with a recognizable pattern. The participants also discuss incorporating the Real Reaction logo into the design. The meeting is scheduled to finish at a certain time, and if they finish early, the participants will receive an extra five minutes for lunch. The participants are encouraged to take their headsets off and kick back.
