A group of individuals, including a project manager, an industrial designer, a marketing expert, and a user interface designer, are meeting to design a new remote control. They have received a brief to create an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control. The meeting will consist of individual work followed by group meetings, and at the end of each stage, they will try out a whiteboard. The project manager introduces herself and the team members, and they discuss their favourite animals and their favourite characteristics. They are encouraged to take their time and not feel pressured to come up with an answer right away.

A group of people discuss their preferences for animals, mentioning that they are allergic to most animals and that they like whales because they are harmless and interesting. They also mention that their favorite animals are their own dogs, but they are unsure if they are aware that they are chasing their own tails. The group then moves on to discussing the project finance for a remote control, aiming to make 50 million euros and selling it on an international scale. They discuss the cost of production and the selling price, and whether the international market will have any bearing on the design of the product.

The speaker discusses the potential for different regions to have different preferences for remote controls, potentially due to factors such as the complexity of the remote control, the wealth of the country, and the marketing of the product. The speaker also mentions that they don't typically consider purchasing remote controls, but acknowledges that it is a common item that people may consider when purchasing other products. The conversation touches on the idea that the price of a product may appeal to certain markets in certain regions, and that marketing can play a role in determining the perceived value of a product.

The discussion revolves around the design of a new remote control. The priorities for the design could include combining multiple functions, similar to the palm pilot technology. The group also mentions the need for a streamlined design and the possibility of including additional functionalities such as lighting or notes about what to watch. The group also mentions that the current remote controls are still primitive and could benefit from a touch screen or other technological advancements.

The meeting is wrapping up, with the industrial designer, user interface designer, and marketing executive discussing their roles in the project. They are given an example of a coffee machine to work with, but it is mentioned that they may not be limited to designing solely for television remote controls. The main factor in determining production costs is discussed, with the goal of creating a unique selling point for the product. The meeting is adjourned.
