The buttons, wheel, and LCD display are standard options, but the size and materials used for the case can affect these factors. The speaker mentions that there may be restrictions on using certain materials, such as rubber and titanium, and that it may be easier to use one material for cost and complexity reasons.

A person and their partner discuss the components of a new technology product, focusing on the logic chips and the various functions and features of the unit. They discuss the impact of complexity, power options, and the user interface on the cost and production process. The partner mentions that the product should be small and comfortable to hold, while the person mentions that the case can't be curved and certain materials or features are not possible.

The discussion revolves around the design of a remote control for a movie player. The group discusses various options, including using a battery to power a light that illuminates the buttons, using a kinetic mechanism that triggers a light when shaken, and incorporating fruit and vegetable shapes into the design.

The ultimate goal is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product within the remaining time.

The group discusses ideas for a product that should have a cohesive look and feel.

The group discusses ideas for a new electronic device, such as a remote control or a device that can talk to you.

The meeting discusses the design of a device with three different functionalities: a head, body, and inside of a snowman. The buttons for the advanced features could be hidden inside, while the basic ones should be visible on the outside. The location of the buttons has an impact on many aspects of the design. The device could have kinetic power, with the back-up of a battery and support for it. The kinetic aspect may commit the user to moving the device, but it could also be useful for situations where a battery is not available. The group discusses the importance of considering the user experience, including the wear and tear of kinetic watches and remote controls. They also consider the use of backlighting and a glowing case to make the device more user-friendly.

A discussion among three individuals about the design of a mouse. The first person suggests using a jog dial, which is a circular dial that can be rolled, to control the volume and brightness of the mouse.

The third person agrees with the first person and suggests that incorporating a jog dial into the design would be beneficial. The group discusses the importance of simplicity and the need to make a decision on whether to include a jog dial in the design. Ultimately, they agree that incorporating a jog dial would be a good idea.

A meeting is held to discuss a product design. The participants discuss ideas for the design, including incorporating a slogan into the product and using a jog dial.
