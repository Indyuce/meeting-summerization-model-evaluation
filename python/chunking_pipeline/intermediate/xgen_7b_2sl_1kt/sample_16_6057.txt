The text describes a group evaluating a product, specifically a toy called "Doodah." The group discusses the look and feel of the toy, including its color and texture, as well as its new technology, specifically a kinetic element. The group discusses the criteria for each of these factors and assigns scores. The group also discusses the design of the toy, which is not considered a technological innovation.

The evaluation criteria for a product are cost, ease of use, RSI, and whether it gets lost easily. The evaluation is done by considering each criteria and assigning a rating of 1-3, with 1 being the worst and 3 being the best. The product in question is a mobile phone, and the evaluation is done by considering the cost, number of buttons, RSI, and whether it gets lost easily. The evaluation is done by rating each criteria from 1-3, with 1 being the worst and 3 being the best. The product is rated as a 2 for ease of use, 3 for cost, 1 for RSI, and 2 for getting lost.

The meeting is discussing a project where the team has designed a new product that is different from anything that has been done before. The team worked together to come up with ideas and discussed them in four meetings. They are not sure how much profit they will make from the product, but they are confident that it will be within budget. The team is happy with the product they have designed and are proud of their work. They are not sure if this is the last meeting for the project, but they are happy with the progress they have made.

The group discusses a new product called a "remote" for watching TV. They mention that it is different from other remotes because it is new and quirky, and it is also marketable because it is healthy for watching TV and can be used to break TV ornaments without causing damage to the remote. The group also discusses the technology used in the remote, such as a pen with a camera and hand writing recognition software. They mention that the technology is not entirely new, but it is different and marketable. The group also discusses the possibility of filling out another questionnaire for the project.

The meeting participants discuss the possibility of using hand-written recognition technology for a project. They agree that it is the first step but not the final solution. The conversation then shifts to discussing the company Logitech. The meeting is adjourned.
