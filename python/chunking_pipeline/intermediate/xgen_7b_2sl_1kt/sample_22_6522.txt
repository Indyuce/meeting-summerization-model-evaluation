The Industrial Designer will present a television remote control design that is limited to television-only functionality, with the company colors and slogan included. The design must be plastic and avoid metal components, which may cause interference or fire hazards. The energy source should be eco-friendly, possibly with a solar power and alkaline battery backup. The user interface should be made of high-grade recycled plastic, and the silicon-based chip is the industry standard. The remote should be multi-channel, compatible with PAL and NTSC, and have a range of at least 200 feet.

A presentation is given by the User Interface Developer, who presents their technical functions design presentation. They mention the need for an electronic device to be universal and operate on several different types of devices. They also mention the need to send messages to a television set, such as switching on the television or changing channels. The presentation also includes a comparison of two different remote control designs, with the first being more complicated and less user-friendly, and the second being simpler and easier to use. The User Interface Developer also mentions their personal preferences for a remote control design that is simple, easy to use, and has a modern aesthetic.

A marketing team conducted a usability test on TV remotes, finding that the majority of users only need to change the channel, turn the TV on, and adjust the volume. The team also found that fifty percent of users dislike losing or misplacing their remote control. The team discussed the importance of designing a remote that is simple and easy to use, with a focus on primary functions. The team also discussed the possibility of integrating voice recognition technology into the remote control. The team plans to continue testing and refining the remote control design.

A discussion takes place about the design of a remote control for a television. The group considers adding voice recognition, touch screen options, and other high-tech features to the remote. They discuss the potential costs and benefits of these features and consider the target market for the product. They ultimately decide to focus on a younger demographic and design a sleek, simple remote control with basic functions.

The discussion revolves around a remote control for a TV. The group discusses the feasibility of the product, including the cost of materials, the number of face plates included in the package, and the potential market for the product. They also consider the possibility of including a touch screen interface, as well as the quality of the materials used. Ultimately, they decide to go with a plastic casing and a touch screen interface, with the possibility of including additional submenus for possible extra features.

A group of people discuss the design of a remote control for a PDA. They consider including a touch screen, voice recognition, and battery technology. They also discuss the possibility of including different skins for the touch screen interface and the inclusion of company colors and logos. They ultimately decide to go with a touch screen with a focus on aesthetics and simple functions such as channel and volume control. They also consider adding a small paging function and an infrared button for easy access. The group discusses the possibility of using ports and cords for downloading or importing skins, but ultimately decides that it may be too much for this particular PDA. They agree on a black and red interface for the touch screen.

The group discusses a touch screen device that may have the carrier provider name displayed while it loads, which some find too much. They suggest a subliminal message that appears for a half-millisecond as the device turns on, which some think would be sufficient. They also mention battery life and the need for the remote to be easily accessible. The group agrees that putting the logo on the boot-up screen is a good idea and suggests saving a copy of the meeting minutes for future reference.
