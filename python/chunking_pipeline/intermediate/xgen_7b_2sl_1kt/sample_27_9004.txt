The meeting is about conceptual design for a remote control. The team is going to have three presentations, and then they will decide on the remote control concepts. The team will have forty minutes to discuss and make a decision. The first presentation is about trend watching and what customers want in a product. The customer wants fancy and functional designs that are technologically innovative and easy to use. The team is confused about what to do because customers want everything but they don't know exactly what they want. The second presentation is about the Milan and Paris trends in fashion, and the team discusses the fruits and vegetable patterns on clothing, shoes, and furniture. The third presentation is about design preferences, and the team agrees that large buttons with clear labels and illuminated upon touch are important. The team also wants the Real Reaction logo and color scheme to be prominently displayed.

The speaker presents an idea for a new type of remote control for a television, with a retro-style design that appeals to an older generation. They suggest using a dial-style shape with numbers around in an old-fashioned shape, as well as buttons for channel up and down and on-off. They also suggest using a scroll-down option and the idea of a base with simple, sleek buttons. They discuss the possibility of using touch-sensitive buttons and the idea of using a picture to indicate the direction of the button. They also suggest using a combination of both sight and feel to operate the remote. The speaker also mentions that the design is geared towards children and could be changed to a bright yellow color for the company logo.

The speaker discusses the design of a remote control for a DVD player. They provide examples of the design and mention the materials required for its construction, such as rubber for the buttons and fibreglass for the circuit board. They also mention that the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse to save money. The speaker also discusses the different power options for the remote, including solar cells, hand dynamo, and kinetic power. Finally, they mention some suggested casing options.

A presentation discusses options for a remote control, including materials (plastic, rubber, titanium, wood), shapes (straight, curved, double-curved), and functions (push button, scroll function). The manufacturing division mentions the availability of chips for buttons and speakers, and the possibility of incorporating voice recognition technology. The presenter mentions the need to produce enough of each type of remote to meet customer demand, which could drive up the price. The presentation also briefly touches on the development of a sample sensor and speaker chip for voice recognition.

A group of individuals discuss the design and features of a small, portable remote control device. They consider different options for the device's size, weight, and buttons, as well as the potential addition of a locator feature. They also discuss the trade-off between having a base for the device versus a smaller, battery-powered version. The group ultimately decides on a larger, more substantial device with a base, but acknowledges that it may be more difficult to imagine the size of the device before it is made.

A group of individuals discuss the design and materials for a cell phone remote control, considering options such as titanium, wood, and plastic. They also discuss the possibility of producing different versions of the remote with different designs and colors. The group ultimately decides to go with a basic plastic design and offer additional options such as a soft latex cover and a tracker for when the remote is lost. They also consider the type of chip needed for the remote and decide to use a specific code for remote tracking rather than voice activation.

A group of people discuss the design of a new product, a key finder, and its potential features. They consider the possibility of voice activation, battery size and cost, and the design of the key finder's user interface. The group also discusses the idea of introducing a new technology, a sample sensor and speaker, which could potentially replace the need for voice activation. The group agrees that the key finder should have a central button with their logo, and that the design should include a retro phone dial and a four-way scroll. The group also considers the size of the key finder and the buttons, and the possibility of using a larger battery or a smaller lithium battery. The group plans to come back to the discussion at their next meeting.

A group of people discuss ideas for a new product, a remote control. They discuss different features and options, such as a scroll button on the side and buttons on top, and the color and placement of the company logo. They also discuss the material and functionality of the remote control. Some people prefer a certain design or feature, while others have different ideas or concerns. The group ultimately decides on a design for the remote control.

A group of individuals discuss a project involving a logo and buttons. They discuss the placement of the logo and the need for it to be visible. One idea is to use a latex overlay with holes for the buttons, but another option is to leave a space for the logo and have it visible on the back. Another idea is to use a slide with the logo on the right-hand side, but the group is unable to get it to go directly to that slide. They discuss the possibility of using a translucent piece of material to replace the top part of the design and leave the bottom section with the logo visible. The group also discusses the color scheme for the buttons, with some buttons being blue-based and others being illuminated in yellow when pressed. The group agrees on the general design direction for the project and plans to reconvene in the future to finalize the details.

The meeting participants discuss the upcoming project involving modeling clay and the roles of ID and UID in the prototype development. They also mention receiving an email with more information. The meeting is productive and the participants express their appreciation.
