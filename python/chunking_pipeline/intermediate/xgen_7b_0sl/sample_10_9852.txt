The meeting is a functional design meeting where individual participants will show off their work. The agenda for the meeting includes reviewing presentations and discussing new project requirements. The main goal is to come up with the target group and functions of the remote control. The meeting has forty minutes to accomplish this. The secretary will take minutes and send them to the participants after the meeting. The participants will need to email their presentations to the secretary before the meeting. The identified components of the remote control will be integrated into the product design at a technical level. The process is cyclical and feedback from marketing and user interface people is needed. The meeting will also discuss the outdated functionality of teletext and the use of the remote control only for television. The design should be unique and incorporate color and the company's slogan. The functional overview of the remote control will be presented. The secretary will send the minutes to the participants after the meeting.

The speaker is discussing the possibility of targeting people aged 15-35 with a new product, possibly a voice recognition remote control for TVs.

They also mention that the technical specifications of the product should be able to incorporate voice recognition, but they are unsure about the feasibility of this feature. They also consider the possibility of separating the channels on TV and the remote control to make it easier for people to use.
