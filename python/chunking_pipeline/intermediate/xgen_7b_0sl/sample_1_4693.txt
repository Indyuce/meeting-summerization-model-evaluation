The meeting is the kick-off meeting for a project to design a new remote control. The project manager, Laura, introduces herself and the other participants, David, Andrew, and Craig. They are an industrial designer, a marketing expert, and a user interface designer. They have three stages to the design process and will repeat the process three times. At the end of the meeting, they will try out a whiteboard. The participants will draw their favorite animal and summarize its favorite characteristics. The project is supposed to be original, trendy, and user-friendly.

The people in the meeting are discussing the design of a remote control for a product. They are considering the fact that it will be sold internationally and how that will affect the design. They are also considering the price of the remote control and how it will appeal to different markets. They are thinking about adding extra functionalities to the remote control, such as being able to control lighting in the house or record notes about what you want to watch. They are also considering the size of the remote control and how easy it is to lose it.

The meeting discusses a new remote control for televisions and other devices. The participants agree that it would be better to have a touch screen or streamlined design, and that it should have a unique selling point to justify its high production cost. The industrial designer will be working on the functional design, while the user interface and technical functions will be handled by the marketing executive. The participants are asked to keep in mind a coffee machine as an example of a product with similar features.
