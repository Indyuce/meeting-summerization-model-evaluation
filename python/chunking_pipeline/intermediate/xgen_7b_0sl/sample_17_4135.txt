The speaker is conducting a kick-off meeting for a project to create a new remote control. The project aims to create an original, trendy, and user-friendly remote control. The team will be divided into three parts: functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. The team will work individually and then come together to collaborate. The project manager, Rose Lindgren, will introduce herself and the team members. The user interface designer, Iain, will draw his favourite animal, a whale, and the industrial designer, Alima Bucciantini, will draw a turtle. The team will discuss their favourite characteristics of their chosen animals. The team will also discuss the project finances and the profit aim of 15 million Euro.

The discussion is about a new remote control for a TV. The participants have used remote controls for TV, CD player, video recorder, and other devices. They mention that having too many buttons on the remote can be confusing and annoying, especially if the user just wants to turn on and off the TV. They also mention that combining all the buttons from different devices can lead to an overload of features. They suggest having a main remote with only the essential buttons for turning on, off, and changing channels, and another remote with more advanced features like volume control and programmable devices. They also discuss the possibility of including video recorder functions on the main remote, but they are unsure about the technical feasibility.

The group discusses ideas for a new product. They agree that the buttons on the product should be large and not too small for older people or those who are not very coordinated. They also discuss the importance of keeping the size of the buttons in mind when designing the product. The industrial designer will be responsible for creating the working design, the user interface designer will be responsible for the user interface, and the technical functions will be responsible for keeping in mind the buttons and the size of the buttons. They will get specific instructions from their personal coach and will work on their individual tasks before coming back together to share their progress. The group will continue to discuss new ideas and trends in the industry.
