The text describes a meeting between a group of people who are evaluating a new design for a product. They are using a seven-point scale to evaluate the product based on user requirements and things that they have worked on. The group has decided to give the product a maximum score of seven because they think it is attractive and meets the requirements. The group also discussed the operating behavior of the product and decided that it is operable by both right- and left-handed people. They also discussed the length of the product and decided that it is a little bit long but can be opened like this.

The text describes a meeting where the participants discuss a remote control device. They give it different scores based on different aspects such as ergonomics, voice control, and technological innovation. The average score is around six, with three sixes, one five, and one seven.

The group is discussing the design of a device and the costs associated with it. They are looking at a prototype presentation and evaluating criteria, and are now calculating the production costs using an Excel spreadsheet. They are considering removing a sample sensor and replacing it with a simpler beeping device for the speaker. They are also discussing the color of the device and whether it should have a special colored rubber case. The group is trying to stay within a budget of $12.50 per device.
