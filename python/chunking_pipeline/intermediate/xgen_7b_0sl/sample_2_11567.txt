The meeting is discussing the design of a remote control for a television. The attendees have three new requirements: the remote control should only control the television and not other devices like VCRs or DVD players, it should not include teletext functionality, and the company's corporate color and slogan should be incorporated in the design. The attendees also want to keep the design simple and not worry about the technical aspects of the remote control. The meeting will have presentations from attendees and discussion on the design.

The text is a conversation between two people, identified as "ME" and "UI," discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. The person speaking is mostly agreeing with the other person and suggesting ideas for additional features that could be included in the remote control. They also mention the need for individual channel selection and the possibility of adding more features in the future.

The speaker has presented information about remote controls and their current issues, such as being ugly, difficult to use, and expensive. The speaker also mentioned the importance of making the product fashionable and trendy, and that the company wants to make something that appeals to people's aesthetics and ergonomics. The speaker also mentioned that they have found that most people would spend more money for voice recognition, and that there is access to cutting-edge technology in remote control. The speaker also mentioned that they want to separate the different features and make them optional, and that they want to consider current trends in materials and shapes and styles when making the product. The speaker is collecting information and wants to decide on the target audience and prioritize the design features.

The text is a discussion between several people about the target audience for a remote control device. They mention that the device should be aimed at "young professionals" aged between 15 and 35 who have "expendable income" and are "gadgety" and familiar with technology. They also consider including speech recognition technology in the remote control, as it could be useful for people with physical disabilities or those who have difficulty using traditional remotes. The group ultimately decides to narrow down their target audience to the 15-35 age group.

The speakers are discussing the design of a device that can be controlled using voice recognition. They are considering whether to incorporate this feature into the device, and whether it would be worth the expense. They also discuss the basic components of the device, such as a power source, user interface, and logic chip. They consider how they can add more functionality to the device, such as voice recognition, without adding too much complexity.

The meeting discussed the target audience for a new product and the basic features it should have. The product is aimed at the 15-35 age bracket and will have basic functions such as on, off, volume up and down, and skip to a channel. The team also discussed categorizing the controls into three simple categories: audio controls, video controls, and device controls. They also discussed the possibility of including advanced features in the product, but ultimately decided to keep it simple. They also discussed the possibility of including a charging unit for the controller, but ultimately decided to use regular batteries.

The meeting is wrapping up and the participants are discussing what they will do next. The Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer, and Marketing person will each focus on a specific task related to their area of expertise. The group agrees to use a proposed idea by David to categorize their discussions by topic, so that they can easily refer back to them later. The group also discusses what should go in each category, such as audio, visual, and device functions. They also discuss the importance of making sure the product looks good and is easy to hold.
