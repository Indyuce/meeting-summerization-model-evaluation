The meeting is for a design group to discuss the design of a remote control device. The group briefly goes over the notes from the last meeting and discusses the problems with existing remote controls, such as their boring shape and color. The group also discusses the need for the device to switch easily, be contoured, have concave keys, be interchangeable fascias, and be illuminated. The group also discusses the management's new requirements for the device to only cover televisions and incorporate the company logo and colors. The group will have three presentations to present their ideas before discussing the functions of the device.

The text describes a discussion about the design of remote controls for televisions. The participants mention that the current remote controls are too complicated and have too many buttons, which makes them difficult to use for first-time users. They suggest that a simpler design with fewer buttons would be more user-friendly. They also mention that people may be willing to pay more for a remote control with speech recognition technology. The participants discuss different design options, such as having buttons hidden from everyday use or having a remote control with no buttons at all. They also mention technical issues that need to be considered when designing a buttonless remote control.

The group is discussing the design of a remote control for a television. They mention that the remote control should have only essential functions, such as channel and volume settings, and that it should be visually appealing. They also discuss the possibility of incorporating a voice recognition feature and eliminating the limited functionality of teletext. The group also considers the possibility of making the remote control more fashionable and fashion-over-practicality. They also discuss the possibility of making the remote control more affordable by eliminating buttons and making it more visually distinctive.

The speaker is presenting a design for a remote control that has a light-up face plate, changeable face-plates, and a button that makes a noise or lights up when someone has hidden under the couch. The design also includes a vertical shape that can be held in the hand with buttons on it. The speaker mentions that the design needs to be technically feasible and that they are considering using infrared technology instead of traditional remote controls. They also mention that the remote control needs to have a minimum number of buttons and possibly backup volume and channel buttons.

The speakers are discussing a new type of remote control for a digital television that will last for up to ten years. They mention that the battery will probably last for five to ten years, and that the idea is a marketing gimmick to save cost. They also discuss the possibility of using a rechargeable battery, but note that it would need to be recharged by magnetic waves or something similar. They mention that people may forget to put their cordless phones back on the charger, and that the battery in their cell phones only lasts until they plug it in. The speakers also mention that calculators often have a small solar cell that powers the calculator when there is light. They discuss the possibility of using a combination of battery and solar power in the remote control, and note that the battery would only be used when there is not enough light. They also mention that the remote control may not be used for very long, and that the amount of time it is used may depend on who is using it. They conclude by discussing the importance of the user interface designer in creating the remote control.

The group discussed the design of a new television set that will incorporate the company's logo and color scheme. They also discussed the possibility of interchangeable covers for the set. The group agreed that the set will only be sold for television and not for DVD players. They also discussed a previous email that mentioned teletext, but ultimately decided that the email was misinterpreted and the television set will only be sold for television. The group will give some thought to the design of the television set for the next meeting.
