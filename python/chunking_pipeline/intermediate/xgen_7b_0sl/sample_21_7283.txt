The text is a conversation between two people, ID and PM, discussing a project called "Project Finance." They are discussing the design of a remote control that will be sold internationally and need to be a universal remote control that can control various formats such as NTSC, PAL, and DVDs. The remote control is expected to make a profit of fifty million Euros and the designer is tasked with creating a design for the remote control that is simple and easy to use. The designer suggests a touch screen design with a flip feature to allow for easy navigation of different functions. The project manager is also mentioned and is tasked with sorting out the details of the project.

The group is discussing ideas for a new type of remote control for televisions. They are considering a touch screen remote with multi-format features, and discussing ideas for how to make it attractive and user-friendly. They also discuss the importance of the remote's material quality and how it will affect its price. They consider bundling the remote with a phone or other device, and discuss the possibility of including a locator device or a simple button to help users find their remote. They also consider the idea of designing the remote to appeal to a certain demographic, such as older users who may not be as familiar with touch screen technology.

The speaker has discussed initial ideas for a project with their team. They have put the ideas in project documents and will consult them if they need a reminder. They plan to continue working on the project with half an hour remaining. The speaker thanks the team for their help.
