The text is a summary of a functional design meeting. The meeting agenda includes three presentations from each of the participants, discussing new project requirements, and determining the functions of the remote control. The goal of the meeting is to fulfill the user's needs and desires by creating a remote control that is snazzy and high-tech looking, while still being simple to use. The participants discussed the current remote controls and how they do not match well with the operating behavior of the user, as they have to press multiple buttons in order to perform certain actions. The meeting also discussed the importance of including specific technical functions, such as the ability to switch the TV on and off, and the power button.

The text describes a presentation about remote controls for consumer electronics. The speaker argues that the engineering-focused remote controls are more complex and unnecessary for most users, who only need a few buttons to operate their devices. The speaker suggests that the design of the remote control should be simple and user-friendly, with a focus on the most commonly used buttons such as channel, volume, and power. The speaker also mentions the potential use of speech recognition technology, which would allow users to control the remote without having to press buttons. The speaker mentions that they have tried different types of speech recognition in their testing and found that consumers are willing to pay more for a remote control that uses this technology.

The text describes a meeting where the participants are discussing the design of a new TV remote. They are considering different components and functions for the remote, such as a switch between power sources and a way to divert power to different parts of the device. They also discuss the design of the remote, including the use of a large on-off button and larger, round buttons that are not like most remote controls. The participants also discuss the target group for the remote and the functions that should be included.

The text is a summary of a meeting discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. The participants discuss the technical specifications, such as the number of buttons, the functions it should have (e.g. channel, volume, mute), and how it should be able to be found easily. They also discuss the cost of the remote and whether it should have a charger. They also mention that speech recognition may be included, but it would be aimed at a specific demographic. The participants also discuss the budget and the color of the remote control.

The meeting discusses the design of a remote control for a television. The participants agree that the remote control should have only essential buttons such as on/off, volume, mute, channel up and down, and a numerical keypad. They also discuss the possibility of including a menu button that pops up with a menu on the TV. The participants agree that the design should be simple and easy to use, and that the buttons should be large and clearly labeled. They also discuss the possibility of including a button for sub-titles and other functionalities that users may need to access occasionally. The meeting concludes with the participants agreeing to send a questionnaire and summary to each other and to have lunch and individual work time before reviewing the minutes of the meeting.
