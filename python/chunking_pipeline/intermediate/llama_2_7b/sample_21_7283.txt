The conversation revolves around a project to design a remote control for a mobile phone or other devices. The team discusses the project's goals, including creating a universal remote control that can control various devices, making a profit of 50 million Euros internationally, and creating a remote control that can do NTSC, PAL, and other formats. They also discuss the design of the remote control, including making it small and simple, using a touch screen design, and considering the user's needs and wants. The team also brainstorms other ideas for the remote control, such as having a remote with changeable faces or a remote that can control other devices like a microwave or front door.

The conversation is about designing a new type of remote control that is multi-format and can control multiple devices, such as TVs, DVD players, and stereos. The group discusses various features they would like to include, such as a touch screen, a PDA-like pen, and a locator device that can help find the remote. They also consider the material and design of the remote, wanting it to be sleek and high-quality, and discuss the potential price point of around 25 Euros. They also mention the importance of marketing the product to the right target audience and considering the strength of different currencies when selling the remote internationally.
