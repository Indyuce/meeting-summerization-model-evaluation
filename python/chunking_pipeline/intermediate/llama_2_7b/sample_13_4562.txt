The text appears to be a summary of a meeting discussion on a new remote control project. The group is brainstorming ideas and sharing their experiences with remote controls. They are also discussing the project's goals, including the selling price, profit aim, and production cost. The meeting includes a brief discussion on the market range and the expected profit. The group is also expected to come up with some ideas for the new remote control before the meeting ends.

The conversation is centered around designing a new remote control for TVs and other devices. The group discusses various ideas, including a flip-style remote with multiple sides for different functions, a simple remote with only basic buttons, and a remote with ergonomic design for comfort and ease of use. They also consider targeting specific demographics, such as disabled people or those with poor vision, and incorporating special features like large buttons or a cool design. The group agrees that the remote should be affordable and focuses on finding a niche market rather than trying to create a remote that does everything.

The conversation is about designing a new remote control for various devices, including a television, a stereo, and a computer. The group discusses various features they would like to include in the remote, such as a flip-up or lock function to prevent accidental button presses, a tea-making function (which is not feasible), and a lock function like on phones to prevent unauthorized use. They also discuss the roles of each member of the team, including industrial design, user interface design, and marketing, and how their responsibilities overlap in the project. The meeting is then adjourned.
