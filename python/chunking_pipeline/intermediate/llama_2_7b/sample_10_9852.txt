The meeting discussed the design of a new remote control for a television, with a focus on identifying the components and functions of the remote and how they work together. The team discussed the importance of keeping the design simple and clear, and incorporating the company's standard slogan and color scheme. They also discussed the need to do away with the outdated functionality of teletext and to only use the remote control for television functions to keep things simple. The team agreed to send their presentations to the secretary after the meeting for minutes and to email each other with any updates or feedback.

The text discusses the design of a remote control for a television and DVD player. The speaker mentions that they have been looking at other remote controls and comparing their functionality to determine what features are most important for the user. They identify the main functions of the remote control as sending messages to the television set, switching on and off, changing channels, and adjusting the volume. They also mention that they do not want to include complicated functions in the design, as per the last-minute update. The speaker also discusses the size of the remote control and the importance of making it easy to use, with conventions such as the position of the on/off button and the use of red color. They also mention that other functionalities, such as a menu button, could be included but are not necessary at this time due to the last-minute update. Finally, the speaker notes that there are many different things that could be included in the remote control design, such as video CDs, and it may be problematic to choose between them.

The conversation is about a presentation being given by a person (PM) to a group of people (ID, UI) about the usability of remote controls. The PM has prepared a survey of 100 subjects who were observed using remote controls and were given a questionnaire to complete. The survey found that:
* 75% of users find most remote controls ugly
* 80% of users would spend more for a nice-looking remote control
* 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons on a remote control
* The most important features on a remote control are channel selection, power, and volume selection
* People find remote controls annoying because they get lost, are not intuitive, and can cause repetitive strain injury.
The PM is summarizing the findings of the survey and discussing how they can be used to improve the design of remote controls.

The text discusses the preferences of different age groups when it comes to remote controls for TVs.
