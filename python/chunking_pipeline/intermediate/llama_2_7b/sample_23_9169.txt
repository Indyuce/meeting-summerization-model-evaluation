The meeting discussed the design of a remote control for a television, specifically focusing on the conceptual design and the various components that will be included. The group discussed the limitations of their current manufacturer and the possibility of looking to other manufacturers for alternative options. They also discussed the use of a solar battery and the potential for visible light signaling to set the remote apart. Additionally, the group discussed the possibility of producing the remote in different case materials to cater to different tastes.

The conversation revolves around the design and functionality of a new remote control for a coffee maker. The team is discussing various options, including using natural colors and organic shapes, incorporating different skin options, and exploring new technologies such as voice recognition and touch screens. They are also considering the use of rubber as a casing material due to its durability and resistance to damage. The team is aiming to create a user-friendly and technologically innovative remote control that is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing.

The conversation revolves around the development of a new remote control for various devices, with a focus on incorporating a touch screen feature. The team discusses the potential costs and benefits of this feature, as well as the possibility of using cheaper manufacturing options. They also consider the design and functionality of the remote, including the use of recognizable colors and shapes to aid recognition of the features. The team decides to provisionally go with the touch screen feature as their main selling point, with the option to explore cheaper manufacturing options later on.

The conversation revolves around the decision of whether to include a touch screen or voice recognition feature in a remote control. The team discusses the costs and benefits of each option, with voice recognition being seen as the lower-risk option that can be released to the market sooner. They also consider the idea of moving away from a hand-held remote control and instead having a round, sleek device that sits on a table or desk. The team agrees to omit the touch screen in favor of voice recognition and discusses the use of a small backup battery to cover moments when the remote may not be exposed to sunlight.

The conversation revolves around designing a new remote control for a television that breaks away from traditional shapes and functions. The team discusses various ideas, including using a rounded shape, incorporating a touch screen, and using buttons with a menu button and up/down arrows. They also consider using a slide or compartment for additional functions. Cost is a concern, and the team agrees to revisit the touch screen and consider a simpler, more basic design. The team also discusses using rubber buttons for the outside case, sticking with the rubber theme for consistency.

The meeting discussed the design of a new remote control for a media center. The team agreed to stick with a traditional button layout while incorporating unique features such as voice command and multiple case colors. They also decided to target the youth market, particularly those between the ages of 18 and 35, who are more likely to use technological devices. The team assigned tasks to each member, including designing the basic look and feel, laying out the menu options, and conducting product evaluations with pilot tests. The meeting concluded with the team feeling clear about their objectives and ready to begin working on the prototype.
