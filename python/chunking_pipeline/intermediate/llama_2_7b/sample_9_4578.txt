The meeting is about a design project for a new remote control for a television. The team will be working together to create a user-friendly and trendy product. The project will be divided into three components: functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. The team will start by introducing themselves and using the whiteboard to draw their favorite animals and explain their characteristics. The team members are:
* Cat, who is the Marketing Expert and will be responsible for the user requirements specification of the functional design, trend watching in the conceptual design, and product evaluation in the detailed design.
* Maarika, who is the Interface Designer and will be responsible for the design of the remote control.
* PM, who is the Product Manager and will be responsible for overseeing the project.
* ID, who is the Designer and will be responsible for the detailed design of the remote control.
The team will work together to identify the components of the product and create a design that is both functional and user-friendly.

The conversation is about a group of people who are working together on a project, possibly a design project, and they are discussing their roles and responsibilities, as well as sharing their personal preferences and interests. The conversation is quite casual and friendly, with a lot of smiling and nodding.
The speaker, who is identified as "ME" (Maybe Estonia), starts by summarizing the conversation so far, mentioning that they are from Estonia and that they are responsible for designing the technical functions of the remote control. They then ask if there is anything else the other participants would like to know, and one of them, Gaurav, mentions that he is from India and is studying Psycholinguistics.
The conversation then turns to the topic of animals, with the speaker mentioning that they like dogs because they are good friends to people and loyal, and that they find cows interesting because they just sit there eating grass and disturbing nobody. Gaurav agrees and mentions that he also likes cows, and that he is doing his PhD in Psycholinguistics.
Jen, the Project Manager, then joins the conversation and mentions that she is from Australia and that she likes geckos because they remind her of warm places and they used to live in her house in Cambodia. The speaker and Gaurav both express their dislike of snakes.
Jen then provides an overview of the project's budget and profit target, mentioning that they are planning to sell the remote controls for twenty-five Euros each and aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. She also mentions that the finance people estimate that they need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro to reach that profit target.
The conversation then turns to brainstorming ideas for the remote control, with the speaker mentioning that they are just wondering if there are any special features they want to include, and Gaurav suggesting that they could make it more user-friendly. Jen encourages the group to share their ideas and suggests that they keep the conversation going.

The meeting discusses the design and functionality of a new remote control for a TV. The team brainstorms ideas for the remote control, including making it trendy, user-friendly, and original. They consider removing buttons and instead using a menu-based system or a single button for accessing the menu. They also want to prioritize battery life and avoid making the remote control too complicated for new users. The team agrees to provide specific instructions for the design and technical functions once they return to their workspace.
