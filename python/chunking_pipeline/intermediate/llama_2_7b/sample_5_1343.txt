The text appears to be a meeting discussion between a group of people, possibly a team working on a project, discussing the design and features of a new remote control. They are considering various aspects such as size, shape, color, and materials, as well as the addition of special features such as the ability to whistle to locate it if lost. They are also looking into the competition in the market and the prices of other remote controls. The team is divided on the size and shape of the remote control, with some preferring a smaller, more compact design and others suggesting a larger, more traditional design. They also discuss the importance of making the remote control attractive and easy to use.
