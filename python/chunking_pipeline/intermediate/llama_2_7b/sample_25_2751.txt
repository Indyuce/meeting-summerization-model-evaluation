The meeting is being held to discuss the design and development of a new remote control product. The team will be working together to create a remote that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The project manager, Mandy, will lead the team through the agenda, which includes introductions, tool training, and individual work on the project. The team will also discuss the selling price and profit aim for the product, as well as the production cost per remote. The team members are encouraged to share their ideas and experiences with remote controls and to offer any contributions they can to the project.

The meeting discussed the design and functionality of a new remote control product. The team agreed on several key points:
* The product should be ergonomic and feel good in the user's hand.
* The design should be visually appealing and high-tech, with flashy lights or other eye-catching features.
* The remote should be easy to use and have simple, intuitive controls.
* The team will consider using triple-A batteries for a thinner design, but double-A batteries are also an option.
* The team will also consider the size of the remote and how it will fit in the user's hand.
* The marketing person, Courtney, will work on the user requirements specification, which involves specifying what the user will be looking for in the remote.
* The team will receive more specific instructions via email after the meeting.
* The meeting was officially closed.
