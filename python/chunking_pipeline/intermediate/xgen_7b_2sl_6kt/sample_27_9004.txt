After the meeting, the team discusses their findings and preferences for the remote control concept. They agree that they want a remote that is easy to read, with large buttons, clearly labeled, and that can be programmed to control specific channels. They also discuss the possibility of using voice recognition technology, but ultimately decide that it would not be feasible for their needs. They decide to focus on one design and concept for the remote, and plan to produce it in plastic with a base and batteries. They also decide to produce a basic version of the remote with a cherry-colored cover and options for different materials and battery types.

The meeting discusses the design of a phone with a retro look. The group discusses different ideas for the design, including having a circular button in the middle and scroll buttons on the side. They also discuss the color and placement of the company logo. The group decides to use a latex cover to add a metallic look to the phone. They also discuss the possibility of including a replaceable section for the battery.
