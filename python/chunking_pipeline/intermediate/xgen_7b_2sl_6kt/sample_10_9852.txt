The meeting discusses the design of a remote control for a TV. The goal is to have a remote control that is easy to use, with buttons for switching channels, changing the volume, and going to the next or previous channel. The remote control should also have a menu button for changing things on the screen, such as brightness and similar functions. The last functional requirement is that the remote control should be small and easy to use, with easy-to-find buttons. The user interface requirements have been identified, but the method for incorporating them into the design is not yet clear. The cost of including additional functionalities is also a consideration.

The text is about a group that is designing a remote control for a TV. They are considering targeting a younger audience, who are more likely to pay more for a more stylish remote. They have found that people between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five are the most popular group for this type of remote control. They discuss the popularity of voice recognition technology and how it could be incorporated into the remote control. They also discuss the possibility of using a beeper button on the TV, which would allow the user to locate the remote control if they have lost it. They plan to continue working on the project and will have a lunch break before continuing.
