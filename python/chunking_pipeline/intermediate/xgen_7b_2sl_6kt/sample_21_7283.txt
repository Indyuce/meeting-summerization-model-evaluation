A group of individuals discuss ideas for a new product, such as a multi-plate face plate for televisions or a locator device for remotes. They consider the design, material quality, and pricing of the product, as well as who they will market it to and how they will sell it. They also mention other potential features, such as a button to page the remote or a sleek design similar to Apple's surgical white or titanium products. The group discusses the trade-offs between different features and prices and the need to consider the target market. They plan to document their ideas and revisit them later.
