After the meeting, Catherine, Gabriel, and Reissa discuss the design of a television remote control. They decide to focus on a basic remote with an infra-red energy source and a simple user interface. They also discuss the possibility of adding voice activation and ergonomic design to improve the user experience. Catherine presents the findings of the usability lab and questionnaire results, which indicate that users dislike the current remote control design and would be willing to pay more for a more fashionable and user-friendly remote. The group also discusses the possibility of using Bluetooth instead of infra-red for the energy source.

A group of people discuss the design of a remote control for a company called Real Reaction. They discuss the importance of keeping the company's image and logo consistent across all products, and consider incorporating a symbol or pattern to distinguish their product from others. They also discuss the possibility of incorporating different colors or designs into the remote control. The meeting may be running ahead of schedule, and they discuss how to handle this situation. Some members of the group mention smoking, and the conversation ends with the suggestion to take off their headsets and kick back.
