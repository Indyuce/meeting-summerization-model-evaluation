The audio transcript is about a meeting where the participants discuss the design of a remote control for a component. They discuss the features they want to include, such as a touch screen, voice recognition, and a rubber casing. They also discuss the costs and benefits of each feature and decide to go with a touch screen. They also discuss the possibility of using solar power for the remote control.

The group is discussing ideas for a remote control for a TV in a basement that doesn't have sunlight all the time. They mention the idea of having a backup battery to cover those moments when the remote can't be exposed to sunlight. They also suggest having a hand-held remote control with a sleek, round design that can be placed on a table or something similar. The idea of having buttons on the remote control with basic functionality, such as volume and channel, is also discussed. The group mentions that they want to follow Apple's lead on design and consider using materials such as rubber and a touch screen. They also mention that they want to avoid the traditional shape of a remote and instead focus on a more advanced form of plastic with a tactile response.
