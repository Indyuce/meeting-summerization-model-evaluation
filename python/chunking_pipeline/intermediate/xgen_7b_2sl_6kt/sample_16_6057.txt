The text describes a meeting among a group of people who are evaluating a remote control device called Play-Doh. The device is designed to be ergonomic and fashionable, and it has a kinetic power that allows it to be used without causing RSI. The device is easy to use and does not contain any buttons that are difficult to reach. It is also anti-RSI and has a yellow color that makes it easy to find if it is lost. The device is a success and fits all of the criteria that were set for it.

The meeting has been adjourned. The participants agree to end the conversation as they have strayed off topic.
