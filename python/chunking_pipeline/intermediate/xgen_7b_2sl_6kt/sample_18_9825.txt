The text is a transcript of a meeting discussing a remote control for televisions. The group is aiming for a technological advancement, simplicity, and fashion. They discuss the importance of an easy-to-use remote control and the possibility of adding extra functions that are not as prominent as the main features. They also consider adding a feature that allows the remote to be charged in a convenient location, such as a mobile phone charging station or a small cradle for an iPod. The group also discusses the possibility of using a rechargeable battery to reduce the likelihood of the remote being lost.
