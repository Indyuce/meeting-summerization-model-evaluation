A company meeting is dedicated to designing a functional television remote control. The company decides to streamline the remote's purpose to control only the television, excluding outdated functions like teletext and other device control. The incorporation of corporate colors and slogans is proposed. The presenter seeks input, highlighting the duality of complex and simple remote designs, suggesting advanced functions be tucked into a bottom drawer. The goal is to create a wireless, user-friendly remote with individual control over channels and volume, incorporating more intricate features like a mute button. The company seeks to align high-tech functionality with fashion trends, focusing on a market willing to invest more for intuitive control, particularly voice recognition. The target market narrows to ages 15-35. The finalization stage aims for simplicity, grouping controls and focusing on aesthetics and ergonomics. Responsibilities are assigned to the Industrial, User Interface, and Marketing Designers, centering on components, user interface, and trend analysis. Categories are established for audio, visual, and device functions.
