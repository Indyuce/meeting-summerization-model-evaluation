During the meeting, the focus is on conceptualizing a remote control design. The agenda includes presentations, decision-making based on the abstract design, and addressing various design aspects. The team discusses component design, energy sources, case materials, buttons, and circuit boards. They deliberate over manufacturer limitations and the possibility of exploring other manufacturing options. Environmental sustainability and uniqueness are also considered. Additionally, there's a discussion about testing the market for the product launch. The marketing team reviews trends, emphasizing innovative and technologically advanced designs, including touch screen interfaces and voice recognition technology. The team leans toward using the existing voice recognition system. Another group examines the design of a universal remote control, featuring touch screen technology, voice recognition, and recognizable colors and shapes. Ultimately, the decision is made to implement voice recognition technology for the product. The meeting concludes with plans to target the youth market, focusing on non-remote design, customizable cases, and voice recognition, while also creating a prototype using specific instructions.
