During the kick-off meeting, led by project manager Mandy, a new product design project is introduced. The team's individual roles will be utilized to collectively discuss the functional and conceptual design of a user-friendly remote control for TVs, DVDs, and sound systems. The goal is to create a detailed design for a remote control that will be marketed internationally and is expected to generate a 50 million Euro profit. The meeting emphasizes factors like production cost (12.50 Euros per remote), ergonomics, battery type, and technical functions. The participants unanimously agree to proceed with the working design, technical functions design, and user requirements specification phases of the project.
