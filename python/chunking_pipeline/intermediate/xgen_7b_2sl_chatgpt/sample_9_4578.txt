The meeting kicks off by introducing a project centered around designing a new television remote control with an emphasis on originality, trendiness, and user-friendliness. This project involves three distinct phases: functional design, conceptual design, and detailed design. The participants will engage in both individual work and group meetings throughout the process. During the conceptual design stage, the focus will be on identifying the various components of the product. The meeting includes an interactive session where participants share their favorite animals, draw connections to their roles, and familiarize themselves with project tools. Discussions revolve around optimizing the remote control's design for user-friendliness, incorporating a menu-based system, reducing button complexity, extending battery life, and striking a balance between style and functionality. The participants underscore the significance of catering to user requirements and addressing technical functions within the design.
