During a conceptual design meeting for a remote control, the team aims for a technologically innovative yet user-friendly product. They explore fashion trends, including fruit and vegetable patterns and spongy textures, and emphasize large, illuminated touch-reactive buttons. The team proposes a retro-style telephone-like remote with distinct features, while considering the Real Reaction logo and color scheme. They discuss materials, power sources, and incorporate input from manufacturing. The group plans to present ideas and decide on remote control concepts. Involving different materials, power options, and designs, discussions range from titanium to latex covers. Decisions center on a basic design with options like hard plastic and soft latex covers, along with various battery and chip considerations. The team discusses button placement, materials, and features of a device with buttons on the side and a scroll function. Planning for a future meeting, they defer finalizing buttons, focus on a prototype using modeling clay, and anticipate receiving detailed instructions via email.
