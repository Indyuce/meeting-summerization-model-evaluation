During the conceptual design meeting, the team presents their individual ideas for a remote control. The goal is to create an innovative yet user-friendly product with a fashionable appearance. They consider incorporating recent fashion trends like fruit and vegetable patterns and spongy textures. Discussions revolve around large, illuminated buttons, touch-reactive buttons, and the importance of the Real Reaction logo and color scheme. An idea for a retro-style telephone-like remote with large on/off and channel buttons is proposed. Considerations include button shapes, materials, power sources, and the potential for solar or kinetic power. A compact design with a rechargeable battery base and limited buttons is agreed upon, and the possibility of voice activation is explored. The meeting concludes with a focus on prototype creation and further instructions for the project.
