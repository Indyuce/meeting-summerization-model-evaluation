During the detailed design meeting, participants assess a remote control prototype for a vegetable peeler, considering evaluation criteria set by Cat, financial limitations, and production process. The design features a banana-inspired shape and color, flip-open functionality with an LCD user interface, and basic buttons for numbers, on/off, and channel flipping. Volume control involves scrolling and muting by holding the middle button. Additional discussions involve design improvements and voice recognition features. The group employs a seven-point scale to evaluate criteria like user requirements and design features, aiming for a balanced product. A conversation highlights design choices, production costs, and component usage. The meeting concludes with project evaluation, budget discussions, and plans for further collaboration.
