During the meeting, the speaker leads a conceptual design discussion for a remote control, covering various presentations and concepts. They explore options for case shapes (flat, curved, double-curved), button types (pushbuttons, scroll wheels, LCD), and battery choices (kinetic, solar, regular). The design emphasizes fashion, simplicity, and a potential kinetic battery. The user interface's importance lies in simplicity and essential functions. Another discussion delves into remote control design, considering LCD displays, technological innovations, and market trends. Fruit and vegetable-shaped buttons using spongy material are considered, along with touch scroll wheels. A group examines product options, including kinetic batteries, circuit boards, and cases. They weigh the pros and cons, leaning towards a simple chip and discussing user interface choices. The project entails creating a curved, colorful case with pushbuttons, focusing on simplicity and practicality.
