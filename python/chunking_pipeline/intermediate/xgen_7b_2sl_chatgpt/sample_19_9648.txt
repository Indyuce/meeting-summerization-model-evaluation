The meeting focuses on the conceptual design of a remote control, addressing components, user interface, trends, and battery options. Different case shapes, button types, and battery choices are considered, with emphasis on fashion, simplicity, and technological innovation. The importance of a functional and visually appealing user interface is highlighted. A discussion arises about using fruit and vegetable shapes for buttons and spongy materials for tactile feedback. The group explores options for a kinetic battery, circuit boards, and case design. The decision-making process for various chip options is postponed. The potential of a scroll wheel for volume control is debated, with no conclusive decision. The meeting also contemplates creating a case with a curved, grippable surface and pushbutton user interface. The team weighs the cost-effectiveness of different button types and discusses the possibility of an on-screen scrollable menu. The meeting ends with the decision to proceed with a simple chip and prototype development.
