During a functional design group's second meeting, presentations focus on a new remote control project. The participants discuss user requirements and technical functions, emphasizing simplicity and usability. The design's front includes button placement, a power source switch, flashiness through a bulb, and a chip for communication. Consideration is given to glow-in-the-dark, larger round buttons and incorporation of the company's color and slogan. Target demographics and functions, such as channel changing and volume control, are deliberated. Age, technical literacy, and education backgrounds are considered. Features like speech recognition and a tracking function are debated. The meeting concludes with plans for questionnaires, summaries, and minutes review.
