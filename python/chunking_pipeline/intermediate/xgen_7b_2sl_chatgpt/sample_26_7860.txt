In the second meeting of the functional design group, participants discuss remote control design aspects. The agenda includes three presentations on new project requirements, remote control functions, and closing the meeting. They aim to balance user requirements and technical functions while shaping the working design. The discussions emphasize simplicity, user-friendliness, and key button placement. Speech recognition technology and a large on-off button are considered for different user demographics. The design's front, button layout, and features like glowing buttons, a power source switch, and tracking capability are explored. The target group's age, technical literacy, and preferences are taken into account, with a focus on essential functions such as channel changing, volume control, and power management. The meeting culminates with plans to distribute a questionnaire and review the meeting's minutes.
