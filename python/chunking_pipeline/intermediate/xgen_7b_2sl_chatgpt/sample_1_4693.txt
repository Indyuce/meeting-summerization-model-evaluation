A team, consisting of a project manager and three designers, is convened to develop a novel remote control. The project encompasses three stages, combining individual and group efforts. The project manager introduces the team, outlines the design's essence of trendiness and user-friendliness, and encourages designers to draw their favorite animals as inspiration. International reach is anticipated for the product, priced at 25 euros, with production costing 12.50 euros. The speaker underscores the remote's adaptability to regional preferences, potential character influences, pricing dynamics, and the consideration of a premium version's cost. The meeting delves into design discussions for the television remote, focusing on features, distinct selling points, and production costs. Design responsibilities are delegated, with industrial design, user interface, and technical functions aligned accordingly. The meeting emphasizes completion, acknowledging the significance of the design's visual appeal and uniqueness.
