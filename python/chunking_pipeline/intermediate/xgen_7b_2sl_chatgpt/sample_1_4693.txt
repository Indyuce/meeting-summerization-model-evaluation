A diverse team comprising a project manager, three designers, and representatives from various departments convenes to strategize the creation of an innovative and user-friendly remote control. The project encompasses three phases that involve both individual and collaborative design efforts. The team is introduced, and the project brief centers on crafting a stylish and intuitive remote control. Designers are prompted to draw inspiration from their favorite animals and synthesize their distinctive attributes into the design. The meeting encourages open discussion and grants designers ample time for deliberation. With a global scope in mind, the projected retail price is 25 euros, while the production cost is set at 12.50 euros. Notably, the sales context (wholesale or retail) remains unspecified. The discourse touches on regional variations, potential design influences, pricing considerations, and the aspiration for an appealing and distinctive product. The convergence of functional, interface, and technical aspects is highlighted, with distinct responsibilities assigned to the industrial designer and marketing executive. Ultimately, the aim is to create an aesthetically appealing, functional, and market-competitive remote control.
