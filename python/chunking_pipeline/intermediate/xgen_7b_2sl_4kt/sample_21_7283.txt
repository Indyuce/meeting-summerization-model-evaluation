A group of people are meeting for a remote control project. The project manager, Marty, is from Victoria and has a Masters degree from UCLA. The other members of the group are Sarah, a cultural studies expert, Ron, a user interface designer, Nathan, a social anthropology student from California, and Chris Bathgate, a local Michigan folk singer. They are discussing what music they like and what they will bring to the meeting. They also discuss the possibility of downloading the new season of Family Guy from the internet.

The finance department has discussed making a profit of fifty million Euros on a universal remote control. The remote needs to be able to do NTSC and PAL as well as various other formats. The designers are asked to come up with a basic function for the remote and what the user wants. They are also asked to consider the cost of producing the remote and how it will be sold. The designers are told that they may need to trade off some features for a lower price. They are also told that they may need to consider who they are marketing the remote to and who they can get it from.
