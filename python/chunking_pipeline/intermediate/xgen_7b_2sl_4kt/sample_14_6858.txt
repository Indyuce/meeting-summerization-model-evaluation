The meeting is about the development of a remote control for a TV. The presenters are Catherine, Gabriel, and Reissa. Catherine is presenting on the design of the remote control, while Gabriel is presenting on the electronic chip that will control the remote. Reissa is the Project Manager and will oversee the presentation and liaise between the three presenters. The meeting is expected to last about 35 minutes and the focus is on the final coming together of the design.

A group of people were surveyed about their preferences for a remote control. The majority of users (75%) found the current remote controls to be ugly, but would spend more money if the remote control looked cool and fancy. The current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user, and often get lost in the room, making it difficult for people to find them. The majority of users (75%) would use only 10% of the buttons on a remote, and many users (72%) would like voice activation. However, the majority of users (60%) from the age of 35-55 do not want a voice activated remote.
