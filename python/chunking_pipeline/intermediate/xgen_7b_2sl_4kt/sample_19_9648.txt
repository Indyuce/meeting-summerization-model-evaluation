After a conceptual design meeting, the team discusses the target audience for the remote control, which is aimed at people who can afford it. They decide on a target group of people who can afford it and are interested in fashion and simplicity. The main objectives are to create a remote control that is simple and fashionable, with a focus on the remote's button design and the possibility of extra functions like sliding or sliding pieces. The team will create a conceptual specification of components, properties, and materials, as well as a conceptual specification of user interface and trend watching.

A group of people are discussing trends in remote controls, fashion, and technology. They mention that people are starting to prefer fancy-looking remote controls over functional ones, and that technology is currently focused on creating innovative designs. They also discuss the idea of using spongy or fruit-shaped materials for remote controls. The group is split on whether they agree with this trend and whether they would prefer to prioritize fashion or functionality in their remote controls. They also mention the possibility of using a spongy material for the remote itself, as well as the possibility of using a wheel-like button for channel flipping.

The group is discussing a project involving a remote control for a device. They are considering different options for the device's function menu, including a scroll wheel or simple buttons. They also discuss the type of case they want for the device, with the consensus being a curved case or a double-curved one. They also discuss the type of chip they want to use and decide on a simple chip. The group is also considering adding a scroll wheel to the remote control, but ultimately decide to stick with simple buttons.
