The meeting is discussing a new remote control project. The objective is to create a TV remote control that is also capable of controlling other devices such as DVD players. The team has some ideas for the design, such as incorporating an LCD display with different pages for different devices, and keeping the cost per unit below $12.50. The team also wants to make the remote control simple and easy to use, while still being able to control multiple devices. Some ideas for the design include a flip phone-like design with a flip open side for more buttons and a flip closed side for a basic set of buttons, and a remote control with a simple interface for adults and a more complicated interface for kids. The team wants to keep the cost low and make the remote control simple and easy to use.

A meeting between a user interface designer (UI), industrial designer (ID), and a marketing person (PM) takes place. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the requirements for a remote control. The UI designer is responsible for determining what buttons the remote control needs, while the ID is responsible for determining what goes inside the box and how the remote control works. The meeting notes that the responsibilities of the UI and ID overlap, and the three participants agree to work together to find out what people want in a remote control. The meeting ends, and the participants are told to finish their work and meet again in thirty minutes.
