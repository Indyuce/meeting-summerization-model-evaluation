The meeting is discussing the design of a remote control for a TV. The purpose of the remote is to make it easy for users to switch on and off the TV, change channels, and control the volume. The team has conducted research and found that users are not happy with the current remote controls, which are often ugly and difficult to use. They suggest that the new remote control should be simple and high-tech looking, with only ten percent of the buttons being used. The team also mentions that speech recognition is an up-and-coming feature that consumers are interested in, and that the remote could include this feature. The team suggests that the remote control should be open to a wide range of consumers and should not be too corny or marketing-focused.

The group is discussing the requirements for a new TV remote. They want to include features such as a TV guide, weather information, and the ability to change channels and turn on/off the TV. They also want to promote their company by including their logo and color in the remote. The group is considering using a speech recognition feature, but it may not be feasible due to the age demographic they are targeting. They also want to include a button for finding the remote, and possibly a homing device. The group is discussing the cost of the project and the target audience.
