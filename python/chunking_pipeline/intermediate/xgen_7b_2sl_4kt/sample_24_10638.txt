The text is about a meeting of industrial designers, Ron and Sarah, with Nathan, and Ann, the Industrial Designer, to discuss the prototype for a remote control for a television. They discussed the importance of having a touch screen, but decided to go with a remote with large buttons for primary functions and a slide-out panel for more advanced functions. They also discussed the use of a voice recognition feature, which was developed by the UI designer. The prototype was developed and tested, and the cost came in at about 11.99, which was cheaper than the goal of 12.50. The voice recognition feature is a new product, and the company may be able to get cheaper versions if they are interested.
