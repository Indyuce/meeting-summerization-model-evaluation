A kick-off meeting for a new product design project is being held. The project manager, Mandy, introduces the team members and their roles, including tool training, project planning, and detailed design. The team will be making a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The functional design will involve discussing the features and goal of the remote, and individual work will be done on that. Conceptual design will involve a basic overview of the project and individual work. The detailed design will involve getting the actual schematics of the remote. The project will be divided into whiteboard discussions and individual work. The team will also discuss the selling price and profit aim for the product.
