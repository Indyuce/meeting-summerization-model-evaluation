After the initial meeting, the team will proceed with individual work and then a meeting to discuss their progress. At this point, they will discuss and prioritize different stages of the design process, including prototyping and testing. The team will also discuss the possibility of using a touch screen or other technology to improve the remote control's design.

The meeting is wrapping up, with the industrial designer, user interface designer, and marketing executive discussing their roles in the design process. They are given an example of a coffee machine and are asked if they are designing for features beyond just coffee machines. The decision on what to include in the design is left up to the team, with the goal of creating a unique selling point and keeping production costs within a certain limit.
