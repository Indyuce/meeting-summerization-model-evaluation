A group of individuals meet to discuss a design project for a new remote control. The project manager, Laura, introduces herself and the other participants, David, Andrew, and Craig. They discuss the project brief, which involves designing a trendy, original, and user-friendly remote control. The project will be divided into three stages, with individual work followed by a meeting to discuss progress. At the meeting, Craig draws a blue beagle and explains that it is his favorite animal because it is willing to receive a lot of physical affection from its family, has personality, and is fit and healthy. The group discusses the project finance and aims to make 50 million euros by selling the remote control on an international scale for 25 euros wholesale. They also discuss the possibility that the price may be set by the retailer.

The speaker discusses the potential design of a remote control, considering factors such as the complexity of characters and keypad styles, the need for different languages, and the potential cost of the product. They also consider the possibility of including extra functionalities such as lighting, notes, and integration with other devices. The speaker mentions that they are not familiar with the market for remote controls and that the cost of the product will likely be a factor in its appeal. The speaker also mentions that the palm pilot is an example of a successful technology that has expanded its functionality over time.

The meeting is wrapping up with the industrial designer, user interface designer, and marketing executive discussing the functional design stage for a product. They discuss the example of a coffee machine and whether they are designing for a television remote control or something beyond it. The main factor in production cost is mentioned as a factor in determining the unique selling point of the product. The meeting ends with everyone agreeing to move on to the functional design stage.
