A group of individuals discuss a new product called a "Play-Doh" remote. It is edible and chew-proof, and has a design that is easy to use and different from other remotes on the market. The group discusses the importance of ergonomics, the size of the remote, and the need for a left-handed and right-handed version. They also mention the cost of the product and the possibility of building a double-curved case made of rubber.

The text is an evaluation of a product, specifically a rubber toy called "Doodah." The evaluation is conducted by a group of people who will evaluate each criterion of the product, using a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being true and 7 being false. The first criterion is "look and feel," and the group gives the product a score of 7, as it is not color-wise or spongy. The second criterion is "new technology," and the group gives the product a score of 3, as it is not a technological innovation, but rather a new design. The third criterion is "easy to use," and the group gives the product a score of 2, as it is more geared towards right-handed people than left-handed people. The fourth criterion is "cost," and the group gives the product a score of 1, as it has come in under budget. The fifth criterion is "amount of buttons," and the group gives the product a score of 1, as it contains only the necessary buttons. The sixth criterion is "RSI," and the group gives the product a score of 7, as it is anti-RSI. The seventh criterion is "gets lost," and the group gives the product a score of 2, as it could get lost but can be easily found.

The meeting discusses a project to design a remote control for a TV. The team has come up with a new design that is not just a rehash of an old idea, and they have come up with something new and different. The team has worked well together and has been able to overcome heated discussions and keep the project cool. The team has saved on production costs and does not know how much they are making in profit, as it is handed over to another department. The project was to come up with the product, and it is within budget and does everything that they wanted it to do. The team has designed the product and has a prototype that is marketable and new, unlike other remotes that give people repetitive strain injury. The team has come up with a product that is healthy and makes TV watching fun, and it is not kid-proof but it won't break that. The team has done well and has finished an hour earlier. The team has not tied their cart to a specific horse and has come up with a product that is new and different.
