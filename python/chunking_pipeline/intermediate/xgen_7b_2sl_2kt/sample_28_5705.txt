A group of individuals are discussing a remote control device. The base is gunmetal gray and plastic, with a latex cover that can be replaced. The buttons are a light blue color and have a light-up yellow design. The prototype has a curvature that sticks out from underneath, with a single button that is easy to stick your finger into. The two squared buttons are for the menu, mute, and volume. The last thing is black labelling on top. The group discusses the evaluation criteria and financing of the remote. They also discuss the evaluation criteria of easy to use, fashionable, and does it feel good. The group discusses the average score and the average is two out of seven.

The text describes a project where a team is developing a remote control for a TV. The team members evaluate the project based on several criteria, including innovation, trendiness, and cost. They discuss the design of the remote, which resembles a giant cookie, and decide to go with a lithium battery instead of triple As. They also discuss the components of the remote, including the voice sensor and the scroll wheel, and decide to use a single-curved button instead of regular buttons. The team ultimately decides to go with a single button interface, with one button for the top and one for the sides. They discuss whether to include two buttons for additional functionality, but ultimately decide to stick with one. The team is under budget and under the 12.50 Euro limit, so they can proceed with production.

The team discusses their experience working on a project that was limited to using a TV remote and did not have access to a whiteboard, internet, or digital pens. They mention their frustration with the process and the lack of creativity involved. However, they ultimately found the experience enjoyable and are excited to sell the product, which they believe has the potential to be fashionable and trendy. The team discusses the importance of marketing and creating desire for the product in order to sell it successfully.
