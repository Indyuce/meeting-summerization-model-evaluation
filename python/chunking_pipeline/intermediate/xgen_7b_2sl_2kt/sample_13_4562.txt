A group of people are discussing ideas for a remote control that they would like to have. They mention different ideas for the design, such as one remote that controls multiple devices or a remote with a simple interface for one side and a more complicated interface for the other side. They also mention the importance of keeping the cost low and finding a balance between the technical functions and user interface. The group discusses the possibility of having a backup plan for a basic television remote control, and the idea of creating a remote that is ergonomic and simple to use. The group also mentions the importance of making the remote interesting to buy and sell.

A meeting is held between a user interface designer (UI) and an industrial designer (ID) to discuss their roles and responsibilities in creating a remote control. The UI designer is responsible for determining what buttons are needed and what the user interface should look like, while the ID designer is responsible for determining how the remote control will fit into its box and what materials it should be made from. The two designers will work together to research what people want in a remote control and what buttons are used most often. The meeting is scheduled to continue in 30 minutes.
