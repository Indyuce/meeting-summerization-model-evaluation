The meeting is the detailed design meeting for a remote control. The prototype has been presented and evaluation criteria have been discussed. The product must fit both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. The meeting is scheduled for 15:35-16:15 and has 40 minutes. The remote control is a flip open thing with the shape and color of a banana, and it is made of rubber. The user interface is spongy and has a volume control that is scrolling on the side. The mute button is also included. The meeting is ongoing.

The text is a meeting summary of a group discussing the evaluation criteria for a new design. The group is using a seven-point scale to evaluate the design, with one being completely meets the requirement and seven being does not meet the requirement and requires significant changes. The group discusses the importance of considering user requirements and making a list of them before evaluating the design. They also discuss the importance of considering the operating behavior of the user when evaluating the design. The group ultimately agrees on a seven for evaluation criterion A.

The text is a conversation among four people discussing the features and overall rating of a remote control device. The device has a speaker and buzzer built-in, and can be used to make sounds or emit a beep. The group gives the device a rating of six out of ten, with some people expressing skepticism about the ergonomics of the remote control and the effectiveness of voice control. The group also discusses the possibility of using the remote control in space, and whether or not it can be considered fashionable.

The text describes a discussion between four individuals about a product prototype. They are discussing the costs of producing the product and making adjustments to the prototype presentation. The individuals are using Excel spreadsheets to calculate the production costs and to make adjustments to the prototype. They also discuss the materials used for the product, including rubber and a chip on print. The individuals also mention the presence of a sample sensor and speaker, and the possibility of using a different type of speaker. They also discuss the possibility of using a different type of button for the product, and the possibility of removing the sample sensor. The individuals also discuss the possibility of using a different type of interface for the product, such as a scroll wheel instead of pushbuttons. The individuals also discuss the possibility of removing the sample speaker and the sample sensor, and the possibility of using a different type of button for the product. They also discuss the possibility of using a different type of interface for the product, such as a scroll wheel instead of pushbuttons.

A group of people are discussing a project they worked on. They mention that they had to make some decisions quickly and that they didn't have all the information about the costs of various items. They also mention that they used a whiteboard and digital pens to help with the project. They discuss the benefits of using a whiteboard and digital pens, such as being able to easily make changes and having a way to record notes. They also mention that they had to make some last-minute changes to the project and that it went well overall. They mention that they had a good leader and that they were able to express their ideas without feeling covered up.

A group of individuals discuss a remote control project. They mention that the project was fairly small and allowed for open discussion, resulting in new ideas being generated. However, some individuals mention that they have no experience with remote controls and wonder if someone else may have already thought of the idea. The group also discusses the possibility of patenting the idea, but acknowledges that it may be difficult to determine if the idea is truly new. The meeting concludes with the group discussing their time constraints and the difficulty of meeting within a specific budget.
