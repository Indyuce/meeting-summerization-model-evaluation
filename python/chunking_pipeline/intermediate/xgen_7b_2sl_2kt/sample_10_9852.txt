The meeting is a functional design meeting where the presenter will show their individual work and the agenda is to discuss the new project requirements and target group for the remote control. The meeting is limited to forty minutes to decide on the target group and functions of the remote control. The presenter will email their presentations before the meeting. The presenter has identified the basic components of the remote control and will follow a cyclical process of identifying and updating the design. The teletext functionality is outdated and the remote control should only be used for television. The design should be unique and incorporate color and the company's standard slogan. The energy source feeds into the chip, which communicates with the user interface. The user interface communicates with the chip, which generates a response and sends it to an infrared terminal. The output is an infrared bit code that is communicated to the remote site. There can be a bulb or indicator to show whether the remote is on or communicating. The presenter hopes to keep the design simple and clear. The costs of using advanced technology should be considered. The meeting will continue with discussion of all questions and concerns.

The text describes a discussion about technical functions design for a remote control. The speaker has identified the main function of the remote control as sending messages to the television set, and has identified additional functions such as switching on and off, channel selection, and volume control. The speaker has also identified that most remote controls currently available include other functionalities, but they do not want to include all of these functionalities in their design. The speaker's personal preferences are to keep the remote control small and easy to use, with buttons for on/off, channel numbers, and volume. The speaker has also identified that there are many different types of devices that could be included in the remote control, and it might be problematic to choose between them. The speaker has also identified that the cost of including more functionalities in the remote control would be a consideration.

The usability lab observed remote control use and conducted a survey to determine people's opinions on the design of remote controls. The survey found that 75% of users find current remote controls unattractive, and 80% would spend more to get a nice-looking remote control. The most annoying thing about remote controls is their lack of functionality, with users spending only 10% of the time using most of the buttons. The survey also found that users prefer a sleek, stylish, and sophisticated design, with a preference for minimalism. The most important features of a remote control are channel selection, volume selection, and power. Younger people are more likely to pay more for voice recognition software, and users prefer a long battery life and a locator feature.

The text discusses the target audience for a company's remote control product. The company believes that younger people are more likely to be interested in a sleek and stylish remote control, but surveys show that people between the ages of 15 and 25 are the most popular with this age group. However, people in this age group have a higher disposable income compared to older people, who are more likely to have commitments like mortgages and cars. The company believes that it can still target both age groups, as they are all still young people. The technical specifications for the remote control are still being discussed, with the possibility of incorporating voice recognition technology.

The group discusses the development of a remote control for a TV. They consider incorporating a voice recognition feature and a beeper button to help locate the remote control. They also discuss the importance of keeping the remote control close to the user for easy access and to avoid losing the device. The group plans to continue working on the project and will reconvene after lunch to continue their work.
