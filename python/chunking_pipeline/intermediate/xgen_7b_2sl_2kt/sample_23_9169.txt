A meeting is held to discuss the conceptual design of a remote control. The purpose of the meeting is to turn the abstract design into a more concrete idea. The meeting will focus on deciding on the prototype and making basic decisions on the design. The meeting will also discuss the component design, including the energy source, case, buttons, and circuit board. The meeting will also consider using visible light to create a fun gimmick. The manufacturer's limitations will also be discussed and whether to shop around for other manufacturers will be considered. The meeting will also discuss the environmental friendliness of the design and the possibility of producing the remote in different case materials.

The text describes a meeting where a team is discussing the design of a remote control for a coffee maker. The team is considering different options for the design, including touch screen technology, voice recognition, and different shapes and sizes of buttons. The team also mentions that rubber could be a good option for the casing of the remote control, as it is durable and won't break easily if dropped. The team is considering sticking with what is currently available on the market, but is also open to new ideas and concepts.

The industrial designers are discussing the options for their high-end remote control. They are considering a touch screen or a voice recognition feature, and are discussing the costs and benefits of each option. They mention that they have a design for the voice recognition feature already in-house, and that it would be simpler to implement. They also mention that they have already conducted market research and found that the market wants voice recognition. They ultimately decide to go with the voice recognition feature, as it is simpler and already in-house.

The group discusses ideas for a remote control for a TV. They consider using a backup battery, a small round remote control that looks like a paperweight, or a remote control with buttons that can be used as a hand-held manual. They also consider using voice recognition and a remote control with a menu button and buttons for recording programs. The group discusses the idea of using a touch screen, but ultimately decides to use a simpler, more basic function remote control. They also consider using a round remote control that looks like a paperweight or a round remote control with a menu button and buttons for recording programs.

A group of people are discussing the design of a new device. They agree that they should stick with traditional buttons, but make the casing unique and incorporate voice command. They also want to target the youth market, particularly those aged 18-35, and consider different case colors. They discuss the importance of incorporating a simple design with voice recognition and drop-down menus, and plan to work together to create a prototype using prototype building materials. They will receive specific instructions from their coaches.
