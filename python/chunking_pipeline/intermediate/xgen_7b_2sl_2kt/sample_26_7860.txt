The second meeting of a functional design group discusses the user requirements and technical functions of a remote control. The group wants to determine the working design of the remote control, including its buttons and functions. The group presents their research findings, which show that users are not happy with current remote controls and prefer something snazzy and high-tech but simple to use. The group also discusses the importance of ergonomics for remote control design.

A presentation about a remote control product includes information about the features and design of the product. The team believes that the product should be user-friendly and easy to use, with a modern and eye-catching design. They also mention that the product should be open to a wide range of consumers and that speech recognition technology is an up-and-coming feature that consumers are interested in. The team also discusses the importance of including a power source, a smart chip, and an on-off button in the design. They mention that the product should be able to communicate with various devices and that it should be easy to replace the batteries. The team also suggests that the product should be able to glow in the dark and that it should have a large on-off button. The team is considering including a speech recognition feature in the design.

The meeting discusses the development of a new remote control for a TV. The requirements for the remote include being a TV remote only, not having DVD, TiVo, or stereo capabilities, being multi-functional, promoting the company's name and color, and including teletext. The target group is not specified, but is assumed to be older people. The functions of the remote should include changing the channel, turning the TV on and off, and having a volume and mute button. The meeting also discusses the need for a homing device to help locate the remote if it is lost. The meeting also discusses the possibility of including a charger and speech recognition capabilities in the remote.
