The meeting agenda for a new product design project includes introductions, tool training, project planning, and discussion. The project aims to design a new remote control that is original, trendy, and user-friendly. The team will work on individual design tasks and then meet to discuss and finalize the design. The project will involve detailed design, including obtaining actual schematics of the remote. The team will use a whiteboard for brainstorming and drawing, and will discuss their favorite animals and why. The team will also discuss the selling price and production cost for the remote.

The meeting discusses the design of a remote control for a product. The design should be ergonomic and have a high-tech appearance, but also be simple to use. The design should also have a battery that is easy to change and can handle a double or triple A. The meeting also discusses the importance of considering the size of the battery when making a decision. The next meeting will focus on the working design, which is the technical functions of the remote control. The marketing person, Courtney, will create a user requirements specification to specify what the user will be looking for. The meeting is officially over.
