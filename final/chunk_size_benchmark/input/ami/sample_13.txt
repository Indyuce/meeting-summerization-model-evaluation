at it, but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens.\n<ME> Very nice.\n<ID> If you're all ready.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> So is the agenda?\n<ID> Opening, acquaintance, tool training and project plan, discussion and then closing.\n<ID> Project aim is a new remote control.\n<ID> It's original, uh trendy and it's user-friendly.\n<ME> 'Kay.\n<ID> Project method, functional design, individual work, another meeting, conceptual design, individual work, and a meeting of details design, individual work and a meeting.\n<ID> Tool training.\n<ID> Try out the whiteboard, every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal.\n<ME> Okay.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> Uh Miss Industrial Designer, would you like to go first?\n<PM> Okay.\n<PM> So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm.\n<ID> Yeah, why don't you just c, I think just clip on clip do you have a belt?\n<ME> Clip.\n<ID> Or put 'em in your pocket, yeah.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<PM>

Oh it's a hilarious movie.\n<UI> You have to see it.\n<UI> And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal.\n<UI> But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it.\n<ID> Okay, well done.\n<ME> Great.\n<ME> Me?\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Miss mar Miss Marketing?\n<ME> Okay.\n<ME> Not quite sure how this is gonna work.\n<UI> There go.\n<ME> Cool.\n<ME> Uh well I'll try my best to draw.\n<ME> Can I just draw the face?\n<ID> Um yeah, I think you can just draw the face, but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks.\n<ME> Ooh.\n<ME> It's a cat.\n<ID> That's a very pr pretty cat.\n<ME> Which also has what?\n<ME> A big fat body and big and a long tail.\n<ID> Okay, do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it?\n<ME> Why?\n<ME> Because um cuddly.\n<ME> And usually cats are very friendly.\n<ME> Usually.\n<ME> And they're healing as well.\n<ME> They heal.\n<ME> And they can feel when a human's got problems so So, that's why I like cats.\n<ID> Wow, so they're kinda spiritual.\n<ID> Well done.\n<ME> There we are, that's me.\n<ID> Okay.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> Um, I don't actually have a favourite animal, but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little Uh.\n<ME> Mm-hmm.\n<ID> I honestly can't draw for toffee.\n<ID> Uh.\n<PM> Really?\n<PM> Oh that's a Not bad I would say.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> no no uh That's exactly what it is.\n<UI> A prairie dog?\n<UI> Oh a squirrel?\n<ID> Uh not a very good one Okay, well, you got it's a s It's a squirrel, and I like them, because they're cute and stupid.\n<UI> Yeah, that's pretty good.\n<PM> Very good.\n<ME> Ah.\n<UI> Alright.\n<ID> Right.\n<ID> Okay, so, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working.\n<ID> Mm.\n<ID> Let's move on to the next page.\n<ID> Okay, project finance, selling price twenty five Euros, profit aim fifty million Euros.\n<ME> Market range internationally sold.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> Production cost, ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make.\n<ME> Ah right okay.\n<ID> experience with with remote control, so talk about who who's used what.\n<ID> Any ideas?\n<ID> Stuff like that.\n<ID> Next meeting starts in thirty minutes.\n<ID> At quarter to twelve.\n<UI> So I think before we close uh, we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where.\n<UI> I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide.\n<UI> Uh S Yeah, I think we're I mean before we close the meeting, we're supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ID> Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<PM> Mm.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next, but Okay.\n<UI> Yeah, I think this is just the preliminary, get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe.\n<ID> Right, who's got experiences with remote controls then?\n<ID> Pretty much everybody.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah, I think we've all got Mm.\n<ME> Uh.\n<ID> Um.\n<PM> Is this a TV one we are supposed to make?\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ME> Yeah it's a TV remote control.\n<PM> Okay.\n<ID> 'Kay um.\n<ME> Well.\n<PM> T But how do we know how much uh, I mean, how much do we have per how much?\n<ME> A new remote control for TV.\n<ME> What would I like?\n<ID> W what You want it big do you want it small.\n<ME> Um.\n<ME> Medium.\n<ID> Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and Video and ts hi-fi and stuff.\n<UI> Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas, I mean, you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of TV and if you have whatever associated with TV the DVD player, or something like that, but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something.\n<ID> Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap.\n<UI> Mm.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an LCD display on it that's got different pages for different devices, but that would p that would probably be quite expensive.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ME> Twelve fifty.\n<PM> Twelve fifty.\n<UI> It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit.\n<ME> Each.\n<ID> Per unit, yeah.\n<UI> Cost.\n<PM> So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I don't know how much it would cost.\n<ID> Well at the moment we could, wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like, and then after we after we've found out what we can like, some different ideas, we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not.\n<ME> Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out?\n<PM> Yeah.\n<PM> Right.\n<ID> So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> Um.\n<ME> Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<ME> I mean remote controls can be thin bits.\n<ME> And then you have one for your DVD and you sort of slide it out, and then you have another one, you slide it out.\n<ID> 'Kay.\n<ME> have slides.\n<ME> And then it all comes compact into one.\n<ID> Okay, that's.\n<ME> So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner, and um into one basically.\n<ID> Th that's an idea.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ME> So you just flip them out.\n<ID> Okay.\n<PM> Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR access and stuff, and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel, program plus and minus, and the just the mute button, for example.\n<PM> I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated.\n<ID> One side for kids, one side for adults.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<UI> I'm not sure if that's like I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it.\n<PM> Or grandma as well, you know it's like what is the mute button.\n<PM> No, but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons, but Start breaking up.\n<UI> Oh.\n<UI> Oh okay.\n<ID> Like it or something like a flip telephone, something like that maybe.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<UI> Okay.\n<ME> That would be cool.\n<ME> I was thinking that like a flip.\n<ID> F flip it open and you've got all the buttons, or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe.\n<UI> Mm-hmm.\n<ID> Um, oh we've got five minutes left.\n<ME> Okay.\n<ID> But okay.\n<ME> Um.\n<ID> Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there.\n<UI> Yeah, we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design, what effect the apparatus should have.\n<UI> Okay.\n<UI> Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface, but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the TV, but also devices connected to the to the TV, I mean, be able to operate DVD players, things like that.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't, we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control, that just that is just for a TV, but it's just a really good, nice one.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<UI> Okay.\n<UI> Right.\n<ID> What do you reckon?\n<UI> Yeah, I mean.\n<ID> See 'cause, I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make.\n<UI> Yeah, that's true, maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good TV remote, and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use, uh simple to use, and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote, like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people, certain certain demographic Yeah, no I think you're right.\n<ID> I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> May w you know, maybe even Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah.\n<ME> But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though?\n<ME> I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm.\n<PM> Yeah.\n<ID> Or just one that looks really fucking cool.\n<PM> Could be really light or, I dunno, something special.\n<UI> Yeah, rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah.\n<ID> Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah.\n<PM> Yeah, 'cause at the end of the day if it says just TV remote, doesn't say com combination with all all the r Mm.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once, but you know, that's Yeah.\n<UI> Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> Yeah, that's right.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ID> I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well, but that's not gonna happen.\n<ME> I think a flip up thing, 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway, like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach, and you'd come and sit down and ooh, the telephone's the television switched on or something.\n<ME> So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes, so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something.\n<ID> Okay, like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones, yeah.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ME> But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it.\n<ME> So make it Yeah.\n<ID> Yeah, it's gotta be sellable.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<UI> Yeah, that's true what you were saying, I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function, it can just have a lock function, so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ME> Yeah.\n<ID> Okay.\n<ME> And even for kids as well.\n<ME> It's um it's safer for them, I guess.\n<ME> Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto.\n<ID> No porn channel for children.\n<PM> Okay.\n<ID> Okay.\n<ID> Um alright, so we've got some ideas, we've got um Let's move on.\n<UI> I guess that's good good for now.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> Oops, let's close that.\n<ID> Next meeting, uh okay.\n<ME> W What does IDVIDNME stand for?\n<ID> Industrial Designer um which is Um.\n<ME> Ah ri okay.\n<ME> these are requirement specification.\n<PM> That's Mm.\n<ME> And I'm marketing.\n<ID> Yeah, there you go.\n<ID> So User Interface Designer, that's that's that's you, so you gotta you go, you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need.\n<UI> That's me.\n<UI> Okay.\n<UI> Right.\n<UI> Right.\n<ID> Um.\n<ID> Industrial Designer, you are the one, you know, you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess so, um whether it's what goes into the box, somehow.\n<PM> Mm.\n<PM> Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap, because Yeah.\n<ID> And in marketing User requirements specifications.\n<ME> These are requirement specification.\n<ME> So what the user requires in a remote.\n<ID> Yeah, what Right, okay, yeah.\n<UI> Yeah, it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap.\n<ME> I guess that's what it says.\n<ID> You two you two are gonna be just, I think, you just double up, you know, you working together.\n<UI> Yeah.\n<ID> You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research, see what people want in a remote, what buttons are used more often, and s stuff like that.\n<ME> Mm.\n<ID> Oh, we've been warned to finish the meeting now.\n<ID> Okay.\n<ID> Okay everyone, well done.\n<ID> Good meeting.\n<UI> Alright, see you in thirty minutes.\n<ID> Yeah.\n<ME> So, do we take these off?", "summary": "The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals. The project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote. The project manager then further discussed the roles of the team members."}
